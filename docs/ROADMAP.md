# LQ.AI Open Roadmap

> Live punch list of work on the LQ.AI development roadmap that has **not yet shipped**. Curated so a prospective contributor (or maintainer planning the next milestone) can see, at a glance, what is open, roughly when it should land, and what kind of background it takes to ship.

## What this is

This document distills four other sources into one ordered, labelled list:

- [`docs/PRD.md` §8 Roadmap](PRD.md#8-roadmap) — the milestone plan (M1 → M7).
- [`docs/PRD.md` §9 Deferred Enhancements](PRD.md#9-deferred-enhancements-and-identified-future-work) — the DE-XXX backlog (~150 entries).
- [`docs/HONEST-STATE.md`](HONEST-STATE.md) — what is shipped today vs. deferred.
- The active milestone plans: [M3](M3-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md), [M4](M4-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md), and the [mini-PRD list](contribute/EASIEST-CONTRIBUTIONS.md) for contributor-ready work.

If a row in this doc disagrees with the canonical source, the source wins. Treat this as a navigation aid, not the source of truth — the source documents above are.

## How this is ordered

Within each section, items are listed in the order they should be picked up. Across sections, the ordering reflects the maintainer team's view of dependency and value:

1. **Active milestone work** — finish what's in flight (M4 close-out).
2. **PRD-committed deferrals** — capabilities the PRD promised but punted (M3 descopes that landed on the M4 / community contribution path; M4 Contract Repository).
3. **Contributor-ready mini-PRDs** — short-cycle pickups where the foundation is already in source.
4. **Engineering discipline & operability** — measurable rigor that the project commits to but does not yet enforce.
5. **Compliance & procurement** — framework-mapped docs that unlock procurement conversations.
6. **Skill, UI, provider, and infrastructure expansions** — broad backlog from PRD §9.
7. **Forward-looking M5+** — community-driven workflow intelligence; architectural slots exist.

## Legend

**Complexity** (conceptual difficulty)

- 🟢 **Low** — well-bounded, follows an existing pattern, mostly mechanical.
- 🟡 **Medium** — requires judgment, integration across 2–3 subsystems, or domain context.
- 🔴 **High** — novel work, architectural decisions, or hard cross-cutting interactions.

**Effort** (time for a competent contributor)

- **S** — under a day.
- **M** — a few days.
- **L** — 1–2 weeks.
- **XL** — multi-week / requires sustained focus.

**Skill profile** (who can pick this up)

- **Junior** — first PR territory; rubric is clear, scope is small.
- **Mid** — needs comfort in the relevant subsystem (FastAPI, SvelteKit, LangGraph, Office.js, etc.).
- **Senior** — architectural judgment required; touches the security boundary or load-bearing paths.
- Specialty tags: `Frontend` (SvelteKit), `Backend` (FastAPI / Python), `Gateway` (Python, security-sensitive), `DevOps` (Docker / Helm / CI), `Security`, `AI/ML`, `Legal-domain` (practicing attorney or in-house counsel), `Compliance`, `Office.js`, `Design`.

Items that touch the Inference Gateway, authentication, audit logging, or cryptography require security review per [`.github/CODEOWNERS`](../.github/CODEOWNERS).

## 1. Active milestone work — M4 close-out

The Autonomous Layer is the in-flight milestone. M4 Phase A (substrate + brakes), Phase B (four primitives — memory, precedent, schedules, watches), Phase C (notifications + web dashboard), and M4-D1 (Learn-tab visualization) have all shipped. The remaining work is the executor uplift, the acceptance lap, and the Contract Repository capability that lives alongside the Autonomous Layer in M4 scope.

| # | Item | Source | Complexity | Effort | Skill | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1.1 | **Wire real in-loop agentic work into the executor** | [M4 plan](M4-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md) + commits `d1293b4`, `7da5c47` | 🔴 High | XL | Senior, Backend, AI/ML | Design landed; implementation in progress on the active feature branch. Replaces the placeholder loop in the executor with real per-step tool dispatch through `guarded_tool_call`. |
| 1.2 | **M4-D2 — Boundary-registers flip + docs finalization + fresh-install acceptance** | [M4 §M4-D2](M4-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md) | 🟡 Medium | M | Mid, Backend + Docs | The acceptance lap that flips PRD §3.10 status to "Shipped (v0.4.0)" and runs a clean-stack walkthrough of every M4 surface. |
| 1.3 | **Contract Repository — Auto-Relationship Detection (M4)** | [PRD §3.16](PRD.md#316-contract-repository--auto-relationship-detection-m4); HONEST-STATE §4 | 🔴 High | XL | Senior, Backend + AI/ML | Not yet started in source (no `contract_relationships` table). Pipeline produces a relationship graph (amendments, restatements, references, master/sub) over a KB; user-confirmable edges; operative-document-chain reasoning. Largest single capability still on the M4 plate. |
| 1.4 | DE-293 — Autonomous-layer restraints (R4 economic, R5 temporal, R6 contextual) follow-through | [PRD §9 DE-293](PRD.md#de-293--autonomous-layer-restraints-r4-economic-r5-temporal-r6-contextual) | 🟡 Medium | M | Senior, Backend + Security | Chokepoint shipped; remaining work is the second-pass tuning + per-deployment policy surfaces. |
| 1.5 | DE-294 — Cross-agent handoff validation for autonomous multi-agent flows | [PRD §9 DE-294](PRD.md#de-294--cross-agent-handoff-validation-for-autonomous-multi-agent-flows) | 🔴 High | L | Senior, Backend | Lands once the single-agent v1 (M4-1) is stable; foundation for M5+ multi-agent direction. |
| 1.6 | DE-321 — Watch firing under a future KB-sharing model | [PRD §9 DE-321](PRD.md#de-321--watch-firing-under-a-future-kb-sharing-model-m4-b4-finding) | 🟡 Medium | M | Mid, Backend | Identified during M4-B4; lands when KB sharing across users becomes a thing. |
| 1.7 | DE-322 — Validate playbook/project FK ownership on schedule + watch create | [PRD §9 DE-322](PRD.md#de-322--validate-playbookproject-fk-ownership-on-schedule--watch-create-m4-b3b4-finding) | 🟢 Low | S | Junior, Backend | Authorization tightening at the create endpoints. **`project_id` ownership now validated at all five assignment sites (post-v0.4.0, #133, closing a pre-existing IDOR);** any remaining FK (e.g. playbook) ownership check is what's left. |
| 1.8 | DE-323 — Surface autonomous context proposals on the Matter detail page | [PRD §9 DE-323](PRD.md#de-323--surface-autonomous-context-proposals-on-the-matter-detail-page-m4-c2-finding) | 🟡 Medium | M | Mid, Frontend | Deferred from M4-C2 dashboard; needs a small UI surface on `/lq-ai/matters/[id]`. |
| 1.9 | DE-324 — Global-chrome notification bell for autonomous notifications | [PRD §9 DE-324](PRD.md#de-324--global-chrome-notification-bell-for-autonomous-notifications-m4-c2-finding) | 🟡 Medium | M | Mid, Frontend | Adds a top-chrome bell with the unread count from `/api/v1/notifications`. |
| 1.10 | DE-333 — Dedupe correlated artifact storage-failure warn findings | [PRD §9 DE-333](PRD.md#de-333--dedupe-correlated-artifact-storage-failure-warn-findings) | 🟢 Low | S | Junior, Backend | Robustness follow-on to document-grade artifacts (#138): collapse correlated storage-failure warn findings so a single MinIO outage does not flood a session's findings. |

## 2. PRD-committed capabilities deferred to M4 / community

M3 shipped most of its plate (Playbooks, Tabular Review, the M3 plumbing for Slack/Teams and the Word add-in), but three user-facing surfaces were intentionally descoped during M3 to keep the milestone scoped to the engine work + plumbing. These are the highest-leverage community pickups today.

| # | Item | Source | Complexity | Effort | Skill | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2.1 | **DE-287 — Word add-in feature surface (chat, skills, playbooks, tier badge)** | [PRD §9 DE-287](PRD.md#de-287--word-add-in-feature-surface-chat-skills-playbooks-tier-badge--deferred-to-m4--community-contribution); [M3 §M3-B3..B6](M3-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md) | 🔴 High | XL | Senior, Office.js + Frontend | The scaffold, OAuth, and version handshake ship in v0.3.0 (M3-B1/B2/B8). What remains: chat against the open doc, apply skills to selection or document, execute Playbooks with tracked-changes redlines + Word comments, and the inference-tier badge in the task pane. |
| 2.2 | **DE-288 — Slack/Teams `/lq` slash command + `/lq ask` quick-skill flow** | [PRD §9 DE-288](PRD.md#de-288--slackteams-lq-slash-command--quick-skill-flow--deferred-to-m4--community-contribution); [M3 §M3-D2/D3](M3-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md) | 🟡 Medium | L | Mid, Backend (`slack-bridge`/`teams-bridge` services) | OAuth install + identity mapping plumbing shipped in M3-D1/D3. What remains: the `/lq` (forward-as-chat) and `/lq ask` (quick-skill) flows on both bridges + the admin UI dropdown to pick a quick-ask skill. |
| 2.3 | **DE-295 — Word add-in code-signing certificate + signed manifest CI** | [PRD §9 DE-295](PRD.md#de-295--word-add-in-code-signing-certificate--signed-manifest-ci-community-led) | 🟡 Medium | M | Mid, DevOps + Office.js | The unsigned-manifest sideload path ships in v0.3.0. What remains: cert procurement (community Phase A), CI integration for signed manifest builds, distribution package. Removes the "unsigned add-in" warning in Microsoft 365 Admin Center. |
| 2.4 | DE-296 — Tabular Review document-source surface: Project-scoped + free-pick | [PRD §9 DE-296](PRD.md#de-296--tabular-review-document-source-surface-project-scoped--free-pick-deferred-from-m3-c3) | 🟡 Medium | M | Mid, Frontend + Backend | Deferred from M3-C3; replaces the document-id paste-in with a real picker. |
| 2.5 | DE-297 — Table-mode skill authoring UI in `/skills/new` (column editor) | [PRD §9 DE-297](PRD.md#de-297--table-mode-skill-authoring-ui-in-skillsnew-column-editor-deferred-from-m3-c3) | 🟡 Medium | M | Mid, Frontend | Column-editor UX so attorneys can author tabular skills without hand-editing YAML. |
| 2.6 | DE-298 — Tabular Review built-ins browser polish on `/skills` page | [PRD §9 DE-298](PRD.md#de-298--tabular-review-built-ins-browser-polish-on-skills-page-deferred-from-m3-c3) | 🟢 Low | S | Junior, Frontend | UI polish on the skill catalog so table skills are discoverable. |
| 2.7 | DE-304 — Tabular Review bulk operations: redline-per-row + summarize-column | [PRD §9 DE-304](PRD.md#de-304--tabular-review-bulk-operations-redline-per-row--summarize-column-deferred-from-m3-c4) | 🔴 High | L | Senior, Backend + Frontend | Extends the tabular workflow with bulk redline / summarize actions. |
| 2.8 | DE-309 — Tabular cells: real Citation-Engine-backed provenance | [PRD §9 DE-309](PRD.md#de-309--tabular-cells-real-citation-engine-backed-provenance-m3-e1-finding-f6-follow-on) | 🟡 Medium | M | Mid, Backend | Routes tabular cell extraction through the M2 Citation Engine cascade instead of the placeholder. **Partial progress (post-v0.4.0, #125):** the read-side now resolves each cell citation to its source file/page/text (navigable drawer); what remains is the executor minting real Citation-Engine rows. |
| 2.9 | DE-310 — Tabular per-cell `tier_used` + `cost_usd` propagation from the gateway | [PRD §9 DE-310](PRD.md#de-310--tabular-per-cell-tier_used--cost_usd-propagation-from-the-gateway-m3-e1-finding-f6-telemetry) | 🟡 Medium | M | Mid, Backend + Gateway | Surfaces per-cell tier + cost in the tabular results envelope. |
| 2.10 | DE-330 — Formalize the tabular `results` OpenAPI schema (typed cell/citation components) | [PRD §9 DE-330](PRD.md#de-330--formalize-the-tabular-results-openapi-schema-typed-cellcitation-components) | 🟢 Low | S | Junior, Backend | The #125 cell-citation enrichment fields (`source_file_id`/`source_page`/`source_text`) are untyped in the generated client; type the cell/citation components. |
| 2.11 | DE-331 — Mid-run ensemble verification cost ceiling for Tabular Review | [PRD §9 DE-331](PRD.md#de-331--mid-run-ensemble-verification-cost-ceiling-for-tabular-review) | 🟡 Medium | M | Mid, Backend | Per-column ensemble verification ships (#127) with no mid-run per-cell cost ceiling — only the pre-flight preview + confirmed ceiling guard; add a mid-run cap like the chat path. |
| 2.12 | DE-308 — Easy Playbook clustering over-segments and can miss a designed axis | [PRD §9 DE-308](PRD.md#de-308--easy-playbook-clustering-over-segments-and-can-miss-a-designed-axis-m3-e1-finding-f5) | 🟡 Medium | M | Mid, AI/ML + Backend | Tuning pass on the Easy Playbook clustering pipeline; needs eval against a corpus. |

## 4. Engineering discipline & quality

The project commits to measurable rigor; today many of these are documented intent rather than enforced gates. Closing them turns the engineering posture from "asserted" into "verifiable."

## 11. Forward-looking — M5+ Workflow Intelligence

**Status:** Community-driven; not committed in v1–v4. The maintainer team will coordinate direction; the architectural slots needed (the MCP-client subsystem; the Autonomous Layer extensibility) are committed in M1–M4 so this work is community-extensible rather than requiring core refactoring. See [PRD §8.5](PRD.md#m5m7--forward-looking-workflow-intelligence-community-driven-not-committed).

## 12. Out-of-scope / Permanently deferred

These appear in PRD §9 but the project does not currently plan to implement them. Listed here for completeness; do not claim without an upfront maintainer discussion to confirm fit.

| # | Item | Source | Reason out of scope |
|---|---|---|---|
| 12.1 | DE-040 — Direct CLM integration | [DE-040](PRD.md#de-040--direct-clm-integration) | LQ.AI is not a CLM; MCP path (M5+) is the integration story. |
| 12.2 | DE-041 — E-discovery capabilities | [DE-041](PRD.md#de-041--e-discovery-capabilities) | Different domain; outside the in-house-counsel value prop. |
| 12.3 | DE-042 — Mobile applications | [DE-042](PRD.md#de-042--mobile-applications) | PWA path via the web app for v1–v4. |
| 12.4 | DE-013 — Saved Prompts Library | [DE-013](PRD.md#de-013--saved-prompts-library) | Shipped in M1 — confirm before claiming. |
| 12.5 | DE-289 — Lavern as design reference for the Autonomous Layer / full-path ensemble / MCP catalog | [DE-289](PRD.md#de-289--lavern-as-design-reference-for-the-autonomous-layer-full-path-ensemble-and-mcp-catalog) | Design reference, not an implementation item. |
| 12.6 | DE-290 — Boundary-registers posture document | [DE-290](PRD.md#de-290--boundary-registers-posture-document--shipped-with-this-pr) | Shipped. |

## How to claim work

1. Find an item that matches your skills and bandwidth using the labels above.
2. Open a GitHub issue with the item ID (e.g., "DE-103" or "1.3 Contract Repository") as the title.
3. Comment "I'd like to take this." A maintainer responds within ~7 days.
4. Follow the source mini-PRD (where one exists) or the PRD §9 entry for scope + acceptance criteria.
5. Engineering process: [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](../CONTRIBUTING.md). Skill content: [`skills/CONTRIBUTING.md`](../skills/CONTRIBUTING.md) — the practicing-attorney attestation applies.

For larger items (XL, or anything tagged "Senior, Architectural"), open a discussion first so the maintainer team can confirm fit and resolve any open design questions in writing before you spend a weekend.

## How this doc is maintained

This document is regenerated against the source-of-truth docs (PRD §8, PRD §9, HONEST-STATE, the milestone plans) when items ship or when new gaps are identified. The expectation is **a refresh per release** (and when a community PR closes a row, the row moves out and a maintainer updates this doc as part of the PR).

If a row in this doc is wrong — the item shipped, the scope changed, the labels are off — the source document is canonical. Open an issue or, even better, a PR fixing this doc alongside the source update.

**Last regenerated:** 2026-05-29.
