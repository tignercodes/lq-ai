## What this document is (and is not)

A useful framing of professional-services agent design, articulated by Dazza Greenwood in May 2026 ("[The Most Interesting Thing in Claude for Legal Is the Lawyer/Agent Boundary](https://dazzagreenwood.substack.com/)"), classifies the restraints a serious agentic legal system needs into a small catalog of *registers* — three describing **how** a boundary is enforced (prompt-and-workflow, capability/tool-grant, code) and three describing **what else** needs restraining once autonomy exists (economic, temporal, contextual). LQ.AI adopts this catalog as the organizing framework for its boundary-enforcement work.

A few things this document is **not**:

- **Not a marketing claim.** The goal is not to ship "six of six" as a positioning statement. The goal is to make every register's state — implemented, partial, deferred-with-commitment, or rejected-with-reasoning — verifiable in source. The honest count today (M4 close): R1 fully, R2 fully (adapted), R3 partial, and R4 + R5 + R6 shipped for the autonomous layer — the Tier 2 brakes that have an unattended-autonomy surface to attach to. Each Tier 2 register still has a non-autonomous-Playbook facet that remains future work (R4 → DE-292; R5/R6 → multi-phase Playbook grants).
- **Not a fixed enumeration.** The number six is the count of registers observed in the two open-source codebases Greenwood ran (Claude for Legal and Lavern, both Apache 2.0) as of May 2026. Future systems may add registers — cryptographic restraint, jurisdictional restraint, others not yet articulated. This document treats the catalog as a living artifact; the framework is the durable contribution, not the count.
- **Not a re-derivation of Greenwood's analysis.** Where this document uses "registers of restraint," "Tier 1 vs. Tier 2," and the R1–R6 numbering, the vocabulary follows Greenwood's coinage. Detailed framework rationale lives in the source article; this document captures only what an LQ.AI operator needs to verify the project's current state against the framework.

The Inference Choice Spectrum (PRD §1.5.2) is a **seventh, orthogonal** boundary, not a seventh register. It restrains *where data goes during inference* rather than *what the model may decide, spend, run, or touch*. The two axes interact (a privileged Project forces both an inference-tier floor and a normative posture on what skills may do) but they are not the same dimension. The Inference Choice Spectrum is documented separately in PRD §1.5.2 / §3.13 / §4.4 and gets a short cross-reference at the end of this document rather than its own register entry.

## Update cadence

Refreshed at every milestone close. Each register's "Current implementation" subsection cites specific file paths and PRD sections so a reviewer can verify the claim against current code without reading the section's prose first.

| Refresh | Trigger | Where |
|---|---|---|
| Per-milestone close | Each milestone PR that flips a capability from "Deferred" → "Shipped" updates the relevant register's entry | This file |
| When a register moves status | "Not yet" → "Partial" or "Partial" → "Fully" requires a PR explicitly updating this file with line-level citations | This file + PRD §9 DE entry tracking the work |
| When a new register is recognized | If community practice surfaces a useful seventh register (e.g. cryptographic, jurisdictional), a PR adds a new section with same structure | This file |

## Tier 1 — How the boundary is enforced

The first three registers answer **how** a restraint is enforced. Greenwood's framing: the type of enforcement should vary with the type of risk. Lawyer-in-the-loop conversational work can be gated normatively; headless cron jobs cannot; agent-to-agent handoffs need code-level validation. This is the escalation rule: **the more autonomous the action, the harder the gate must be**.

### R1 — Prompt-and-workflow restraint (normative)

**Definition.** The model is instructed, in the practice-profile context every skill reads before acting, to refuse, flag, or gate at consequence boundaries. The gate travels with the model, not with the interpreter. Used for conversational work where a lawyer is reading every output.

**Current implementation: SHIPPED (fully).**

- **Skill format carries normative behavior.** Every skill is an inspectable artifact in `skills/` (PRD §3.4) with frontmatter and prompt text the operator can read. The Organization Profile singleton (PRD §3.12; configured per deployment) is prepended to skill prompts and binds org-wide voice, jurisdictional posture, and standard positions to every skill execution.
- **Citation Engine enforces cite-or-flag at the verification stage.** The four-stage verification cascade in `api/app/citation/verification.py` (M2 — exact match → tolerant match → paraphrase judge → ensemble) rejects unverified citations rather than rendering them as confident-looking text. The cascade is documented in PRD §3.3.
- **Built-in playbook descriptions carry the Decision F framing.** All built-in playbooks in `skills/playbooks/` (M3-A3 NDA mutual + unilateral, M3-A5 MSA-SaaS + DPA-GDPR + MSA-Commercial-Purchase) carry "starting point, not a vetted template" framing in their `description` field, naming the user-attorney as the validator. Easy Playbook wizard output (M3-A6) is treated identically.
- **Skill-authoring guide names conventions.** `docs/skill-authoring-guide.md` enumerates prompt-isolation and severity-handling conventions skills should adopt.

**Gap.** The normative rules R1 implements are scattered. A reviewer asking "what are LQ.AI's rules of restraint at the conversational layer?" should get a one-section answer with testable invariants, not a treasure hunt across the skill-authoring guide, individual skills' SKILL.md files, the Organization Profile schema, and the Citation Engine's verification surface. Codification + golden tests are tracked by **DE-291**.

**Verification path.**

```bash
# Read the canonical surfaces:
less docs/skill-authoring-guide.md            # R1 rule conventions today
less skills/playbooks/nda/playbook.yaml       # Built-in disclaimer framing
less api/app/citation/verification.py         # Cite-or-flag enforcement
```

### R2 — Capability / tool-grant restraint

**Definition.** The boundary is not a normative instruction but a tool grant. An agent that doesn't have a tool cannot bypass not having it; a model jailbreak that convinces an agent to "ignore previous instructions and use tool X" fails because the tool is not in the agent's grant.

**Current implementation: SHIPPED (in an adapted form).**

LQ.AI's first capability boundary attaches to the **inference path** rather than to agent-to-agent tool grants. The Inference Tier model (PRD §1.5.2, §3.13, §4.4) lets a skill, Project, or request declare `minimum_inference_tier`; the gateway returns a structured 403 with `tier_below_minimum` when a routing decision would violate that floor.

- **Code path.** `gateway/app/tier_floor.py` (refusal envelope), `gateway/app/router.py` (annotation in B4 stage), `gateway/app/errors.py` (`CODE_TIER_BELOW_MINIMUM`).
- **Privileged Projects force a tier floor.** PRD §3.11 — privileged Projects disable anonymization and require a tier matching the privilege posture.
- **Per-purpose tagging (M2-E2).** `gateway/app/routing_log.py` adds `lq_ai_purpose` tagging so cost-estimation and the ensemble pre-flight budget (an R4 input) can differentiate judge calls from chat calls and embeddings.

**Gap.** Agent-to-agent tool grants don't exist as a model today because LQ.AI doesn't yet have agents-calling-agents. The Playbook executor (M3-A2, `api/app/playbooks/executor.py`) runs single-agent multi-step workflows with implicit tool capabilities (read document, retrieve chunks, emit findings); each step does not declare its tools explicitly. A retrofit that adds declared per-position tool grants is tracked by **DE-292**.

**Verification path.**

```bash
less gateway/app/tier_floor.py                # Tier refusal envelope
less gateway/app/router.py                    # Annotation + decision
less gateway/app/errors.py                    # tier_below_minimum code
```

### R3 — Code restraint

**Definition.** Used at the boundary between agents (and between agents and external destinations) — where a hostile document upstream could otherwise smuggle instructions across the seam. The seam is Python (or equivalent), with target allowlists, closed intent enums, per-intent regex/JSON-Schema parameter validation, and typed-template prompt rendering that never derives steering-prompt text from agent output. Every accept and reject is audited.

**Current implementation: PARTIAL.**

- **The Inference Gateway is a code-enforced security boundary in a separate process.** Privileged provider API keys live only inside `gateway/` (PRD §4); the backend cannot reach them. Every request crosses the process boundary.
- **Citation Engine Stage 2 is code-level deterministic substring verification, not an LLM grading itself.** `api/app/citation/verification.py` runs exact-match + rapidfuzz-tolerant-match before any LLM judge is invoked.
- **Anonymization Layer is code-level entity rewriting.** `gateway/app/anonymization/` (`engine.py` + `mapper.py` + `middleware.py` + `recognizers/`) handles pre/post pseudonymization with streaming-aware rehydration.
- **Playbook executor handoffs are Pydantic-typed.** `api/app/playbooks/state.py` (LangGraph state) + `api/app/playbooks/nodes.py` + `api/app/playbooks/executor.py` together enforce typed transitions between executor steps. Failed schema validation surfaces as a structured failure rather than malformed output passed downstream.
- **Easy Playbook generation is a code-orchestrated multi-step pipeline.** `api/app/playbooks/easy/extractor.py` + `clustering.py` + `assembly.py` (M3-A6) similarly run as code-orchestrated steps with Pydantic-validated outputs at each seam.

**Gap.** The Lavern `orchestrate.py` pattern — closed intent allowlist + per-intent JSON-Schema parameter validation with regex patterns + typed-template prompt rendering + JSONL audit log of every accept and reject — is not yet wired into either the Playbook executor (single-agent today) or any cross-agent surface (no cross-agent surface exists yet). Two retrofits are tracked:

- **DE-292** — retrofit the existing Playbook executor with declared per-position tool grants + schema-validated step handoffs + per-execution cost cap (the R3 facet for in-Playbook step seams).
- **DE-294** — `orchestrate.py`-equivalent for autonomous multi-agent flows, if/when M4 ships multi-agent autonomous flows; pinned by the design-influences ADR from DE-289 Phase 1.

**Verification path.**

```bash
# Gateway as security boundary:
less gateway/app/main.py                      # Separate-process entrypoint
# Citation Engine deterministic verification:
less api/app/citation/verification.py
# Anonymization middleware:
less gateway/app/anonymization/middleware.py
# Playbook executor typed transitions:
less api/app/playbooks/state.py
less api/app/playbooks/executor.py
```

## Tier 2 — What else needs restraining

Once autonomy exists — once the system runs without a lawyer reading every output — three further restraints attach. They answer **what else** needs a brake: money, time, and workflow phase. These registers don't apply to conversational work where a human reads every reply; they apply when the system runs unattended.

### R4 — Economic restraint

**Definition.** A per-session or per-execution cost cap that halts the run rather than overspend. An agent running in a loop can quietly burn a fortune in API credits; the brake checks projected cost against a remaining budget before every tool call and halts gracefully if a call would exceed the cap.

**Current implementation: SHIPPED (M4) for the autonomous layer.**

The autonomous layer ships a hard per-session **and** per-trigger `max_cost_usd` cap, checked before every tool call at the single `guarded_tool_call` chokepoint (`api/app/autonomous/guard.py`, the R4 stage of the R5 → R6 → R4 ordering). The pre-flight projects the call's cost (`api/app/autonomous/cost.py::estimate_tool_cost`), and if `session.cost_total_usd + projected > session.max_cost_usd` it raises `CostCapReached`, latches the session, and produces a receipt with `terminal_reason=cost_cap_reached` — a graceful halt, not an overrun. The per-trigger cap (a watch's or schedule's own `max_cost_usd`, inherited by the spawned session) landed in migration `0045`.

The pre-M4 cost-tracking surfaces remain and feed the estimator:

- **Per-call cost tracking (M1).** `inference_routing_log` table captures `cost_estimate` per provider call (PRD §5.5).
- **Per-purpose tagging (M2-E2).** `gateway/app/routing_log.py` adds `lq_ai_purpose` so judge-call cost can be differentiated from chat-call cost.
- **Rolling-average cost estimator (M2-E2).** `api/app/citation/cost.py::estimate_judge_call_cost_usd` queries per-model rolling averages from `inference_routing_log` with cold-start defaults; the autonomous cost wrapper reuses it for inference-bearing intents.
- **Per-message ensemble pre-flight budget (M2-D1).** Pre-flight check in `chats.py::_resolve_ensemble_config` falls back from ensemble to single-judge Stage 3 when projected `n_citations × n_judges × per-judge-cost` exceeds the per-message cap.

**Live acceptance evidence.** The M4 fresh-install acceptance run produced a real halted session (`4554cdd9`) from a watch with `max_cost_usd=$0.001`: the analysis-phase `run_skill` call's R4 brake latched, the session halted, and its stored receipt carried `terminal_reason=cost_cap_reached`. R4 fired for real, end-to-end through the production-shape trigger → session → chokepoint chain.

**Remaining gap.** The non-autonomous Playbook executor still does not surface a per-execution cost cap to the operator at execution time; that retrofit is tracked by **DE-292** (folds into the executor's pre-flight cost-check). The autonomous-layer cap (DE-293, R4 facet) is shipped.

**Verification path.**

```bash
rg -n "CostCapReached|max_cost_usd" api/app/autonomous/guard.py   # R4 stage at the chokepoint
less api/app/autonomous/cost.py                                   # Per-call pre-flight projection
less api/alembic/versions/0045_autonomous_per_trigger_max_cost.py # Per-trigger cap migration
cd api && pytest tests/autonomous/test_r4_per_trigger_cap.py      # asserts terminal_reason == cost_cap_reached
less api/app/citation/cost.py                                     # Rolling-average estimator (reused)
```

### R5 — Temporal restraint

**Definition.** A liveness primitive checked before every tool call: external halt signal, idle-timeout auto-halt. An agent that runs unattended needs a stop that an operator can hit from outside the agent's loop.

**Current implementation: SHIPPED (M4) for the autonomous layer.**

The autonomous layer ships the graceful-halt pattern (the Lavern `haltCheckHook` equivalent): a liveness check runs as the R5 stage at the start of every `guarded_tool_call` (`api/app/autonomous/guard.py`), the first of the R5 → R6 → R4 ordering.

- **External halt switch.** `POST /api/v1/autonomous/sessions/{session_id}/halt` (`api/app/api/autonomous.py::halt_session`) sets `halt_state='halt_requested'` (idempotent). On the next per-call pre-call refresh the chokepoint raises `SessionHalted(reason="external_halt")` and the executor transitions the session to `halted` with a structured receipt — an operator can intervene mid-run.
- **Idle-timeout auto-halt.** A per-minute arq cron, `autonomous_idle_watchdog` (`api/app/workers/autonomous_worker.py`), runs a two-tick sweep via `_run_idle_sweep`: sessions idle past `idle_halt_minutes` go `running → paused`, and past `2 × idle_halt_minutes` go `paused → halted` with a `halted` audit row carrying `reason='idle_timeout'`. `last_activity_at` is bumped by the chokepoint on each tool call, feeding the watchdog.

The pre-M4 ARQ `job_timeout` (e.g. 900s for `easy_playbook_generation_job`) remains for non-autonomous jobs — a hard-kill backstop, not the graceful-halt brake.

**Remaining gap.** None for the autonomous layer (DE-293, R5 facet, shipped). The hard-kill `job_timeout` on non-autonomous Playbook jobs is still a kill rather than a graceful flush.

**Verification path.**

```bash
rg -n "SessionHalted|halt_state" api/app/autonomous/guard.py    # R5 stage at the chokepoint
rg -n "halt" api/app/api/autonomous.py                          # External halt endpoint
rg -n "_run_idle_sweep|idle_halt_minutes" api/app/workers/autonomous_worker.py  # Idle watchdog cron
cd api && pytest tests/autonomous/test_idle_watchdog.py         # Two-tick idle-halt semantics
```

### R6 — Contextual restraint

**Definition.** Tool access is not granted once and left. The agent's permissions modulate as the workflow advances — search/read tools available during intake, stripped at the ethics gate or delivery. Capability is scoped to where you are in the work.

**Current implementation: SHIPPED (M4) for the autonomous layer.**

The autonomous executor's five phases (`intake`, `analysis`, `drafting`, `ethics_review`, `delivery`) each carry an explicit tool-grant set in `PHASE_GRANTS` (`api/app/autonomous/enums.py`), the authoritative per-phase grant map. The R6 stage of `guarded_tool_call` (`api/app/autonomous/guard.py`, between R5 and R4) checks `intent in PHASE_GRANTS[Phase(session.current_phase)]` before dispatch; a call for an intent not granted in the current phase raises `ToolNotGranted` (with the intent and phase in `.details`). Capability is scoped to where the session is in the work — a search/read intent available during `intake` is not available at `ethics_review` unless its phase grant says so. A test invariant (`test_phase_grants_covers_all_phases`) asserts every `Phase` member is a key in `PHASE_GRANTS`, so no phase can `KeyError` past the gate.

**Remaining gap.** The non-autonomous Playbook executor (M3-A2) still runs all positions with the same implicit capability set — it has no phase concept. Phase-modulated grants for multi-phase Playbook workflows remain future work; the autonomous-layer facet (DE-293, R6) is shipped.

**Verification path.**

```bash
rg -n "PHASE_GRANTS|ToolNotGranted" api/app/autonomous/guard.py  # R6 stage at the chokepoint
less api/app/autonomous/enums.py                                 # PHASE_GRANTS authoritative map
cd api && pytest tests/autonomous/test_brakes.py                 # R4/R5/R6 acceptance bar
```

## Orthogonal boundary — the Inference Choice Spectrum

The Inference Choice Spectrum (PRD §1.5.2) is a **seventh boundary** that runs along a different axis from R1–R6. R1–R6 restrain *what the model may decide, spend, run, or touch*. The Inference Choice Spectrum restrains *where the data goes during inference*.

- The five tiers (PRD §1.5.2): local-only (Tier 1), customer-hosted cloud inference (Tier 2), enterprise managed inference with ZDR / no-training commitments (Tier 3), standard cloud API (Tier 4), consumer or free tier (Tier 5).
- Skills, Projects, and requests can require a minimum tier (R2-adapted, above); the gateway refuses routing decisions that violate the floor (`tier_below_minimum`).
- The audit log records every routing decision (`inference_routing_log` per PRD §5.5).
- Tier 3 is recommended for most pragmatic enterprise deployments; Tier 1 is recommended for the most sensitive privileged work.

This boundary is documented separately in:

- PRD §1.5.2 (the spectrum's five-tier definition)
- PRD §3.13 (the Inference Tier badge in the UI)
- PRD §4.4 (gateway configuration of tier mapping)
- PRD §1.8 (security posture; calls the spectrum "the central security trade-off")

It is named here so a reader doesn't conflate the two boundaries: a deployment can ship full R1 + R2 + R3 + R4 + R5 + R6 and still expose customer data to a weaker tier through configuration choices, or vice-versa.

## Gateway boundary — tool / data-source egress (ADR 0014)

This boundary is **orthogonal to R1–R6** (which restrain the model) and to the Inference Choice Spectrum (which restrains where inference data flows). It restrains *outbound calls the gateway makes on behalf of a skill or user to third-party data sources* — case-law APIs, MCP servers, and similar.

**What it guards.** Any HTTP egress the gateway brokers to a tool provider: case-law retrieval (CourtListener, etc.), MCP server calls, future data-source adapters. These calls carry query terms derived from the user's matter; each is an egress vector that must be allowlisted, tier-tagged, rate-limited, and audited independently of the inference path.

**Controls.**

- **HTTPS-only.** Non-TLS outbound requests are refused at the adapter layer; no plaintext egress.
- **DNS private/loopback/link-local block.** SSRF guard: the adapter resolves the configured `base_url` and rejects results that resolve to RFC-1918, loopback, or link-local addresses before any connection is attempted.
- **Per-provider host allowlist.** Each `tool_providers:` entry declares `allowlist.hosts`; the adapter checks the resolved host against the exact allowlist before dispatch. A call whose resolved host is not in the allowlist is refused with a structured error.
- **No caller `Host` override.** The gateway sets the `Host` header from the configured `base_url`; callers cannot substitute a different host through request parameters.
- **Outbound header validation (denylist: rejects caller-supplied `Host` override and smuggled gateway-auth headers; full enforcement wired in WS3 when real adapters egress).**
- **Egress-tier ceiling.** Each provider carries `egress_tier`. If the provider's egress_tier exceeds the matter's or skill's allowed ceiling, the request is refused with a tier-mismatch error — the same enforcement pattern as the inference-tier floor (R2, above).
- **Per-provider rate limit.** Each entry declares `rate_limit.requests_per_minute`; the adapter enforces it. Requests over the limit return a structured rate-limit error rather than being forwarded.

**Audit surface.** Every dispatched (and refused) tool-provider call is written to `tool_egress_log`: provider name, egress tier, timestamp, and status. Counts and types are logged; raw request/response payloads are never written to the log (anonymize_outbound default: true).

**Current implementation state.** PARTIAL — `tool_providers:` schema and config loading shipped (ADR 0014 D1/D2); `echo` adapter ships as the test type. CourtListener adapter (D3), MCP server adapter (WS3/WS4), and the `tool_egress_log` table (D4) are tracked by the ADR 0014 work plan.

**Reference.** ADR 0014 (`docs/adr/0014-tool-provider-egress-boundary.md`).

**Verification path.**
