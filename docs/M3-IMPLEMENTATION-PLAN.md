# M3 Implementation Plan — Playbooks, Word Add-In, Tabular Review, and Slack/Teams

> **Purpose:** Dependency-ordered task list for the M3 build. Each task is a discrete unit of work sized for a focused Claude Code session, with verifiable end-state. Follows the same conventions as [`M1-IMPLEMENTATION-ORDER.md`](M1-IMPLEMENTATION-ORDER.md) and [`M2-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md`](M2-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md).
>
> **Status:** Authoritative once committed. Updates land in the same release cadence as the PRD.
>
> **Audience:** Claude Code or any human contributor implementing M3. Hand this document along with the PRD, `db-schema.md`, the OpenAPI sketches, the gateway config example, and `CLAUDE.md`. Implementation flows from the order documented here.

The M3 milestone is the **feature-parity-and-surface-coverage** release. Four largely-independent tracks ship together:

1. **Playbook engine + 4 built-in playbooks** ([PRD §3.7](PRD.md#37-playbooks)) — Playbook schema, LangGraph executor, Easy Playbook auto-generation wizard, execution UI in web app. 4 built-ins: NDA, Generic SaaS MSA, DPA (GDPR-aligned), Commercial MSA.
2. **Word Add-In (Office.js)** ([PRD §3.9](PRD.md#39-word-add-in-m3)) — **Plumbing only at v0.3.0**: scaffold + OAuth + version handshake + unsigned-manifest sideload via Microsoft 365 Admin Center. Feature surfaces (chat / skills / playbook execution / Inference Tier badge) descoped to M4 per [DE-287](PRD.md#de-287--word-add-in-feature-surface-chat-skills-playbooks-tier-badge--deferred-to-m4--community-contribution). Signed manifest + enterprise distribution package descoped to a community-led effort per [DE-295](PRD.md#de-295--word-add-in-code-signing-certificate--signed-manifest-ci-community-led).
3. **Tabular / Multi-Document Review** ([PRD §3.14](PRD.md#314-tabular--multi-document-review-m3)) — `output_format: table` skill mode; tabular UI surface; bulk operations; XLSX/CSV export; cost preview before execution.
4. **Slack / Teams Light Intake Bridge** ([PRD §3.15](PRD.md#315-slack--teams-light-intake-bridge-m3)) — **Plumbing only at v0.3.0**: OAuth install on Slack and Teams; bot configuration in LQ.AI admin UI. The `/lq` slash-command + `/lq ask` quick-skill surfaces are descoped to M4 per [DE-288](PRD.md#de-288--slackteams-lq-slash-command--quick-skill-flow--deferred-to-m4--community-contribution).

M3 ships in **~5 weeks of focused work** after two rounds of scope-reduction (see effort table below). The phase breakdown is **sequential by complexity**: the Playbook engine is the substrate that Word Add-In and Tabular both build on, and Slack/Teams is the smallest independent surface. Within each phase, parallel-execution slots are marked **[parallel]**.

This document supersedes any conflicting sequencing in earlier roadmap documents. The PRD §8 roadmap remains the canonical capability commitment; this document is the implementation contract.

## Architectural decisions locked for M3

Five architectural decisions are locked at the start of M3; subsequent tasks build on them. Documented here for the agent's clarity and so future contributors understand the reasoning.

### Decision M3-1: LangGraph runtime lives in `api/`, not a separate service

The Playbook executor and the Tabular Review workflow both run as LangGraph workflows. The LangGraph runtime lives **inside the existing `api/` FastAPI service** rather than as a separate `executor/` container.

The reasoning:

- Playbook and Tabular executions are first-class application operations, not background workers — they need synchronous access to skills, citations, knowledge bases, and project RBAC. A separate service would require duplicating auth context and RBAC enforcement.
- The existing `api/app/skills/` module is the natural home for skill orchestration; LangGraph is a substrate for the same orchestration shape. Co-location keeps the surface auditable.
- Long-running playbook executions (PRD §3.7 budgets < 3 min for a 50-page MSA) fit within the existing async-handler model. A worker queue (Celery/RQ) is not warranted at M3 volumes.

The alternative (separate `executor/` container) is documented as **DE-XXX (filed in M3-E2)** in PRD §9 for future consideration if execution-volume or operator-isolation requirements demand it.

### Decision M3-2: Word add-in JS bundle is served by the self-hosted deployment

Per [PRD §3.9 open question](PRD.md#39-word-add-in-m3), the Word add-in's JS bundle is **served by the LQ.AI deployment itself** (option a), not from a LegalQuants-controlled CDN (option b) or GitHub releases (option c).

The reasoning:

- Self-hosted deployments minimize external network dependencies; an add-in that fails when LegalQuants' CDN is down is a procurement-relevant flaw.
- The bundle is small (< 1 MB after Office.js dependencies); serving it from the existing `web/` SvelteKit app adds negligible operational surface.
- Updates ship with the LQ.AI release — the operator's deployment and the add-in are versioned together. No version-skew between a v0.3 backend and a v0.4 add-in.

The add-in manifest XML references the operator's deployment URL (`{deployment_origin}/word-addin/taskpane.html`); the manifest is generated at install time by an admin UI flow (covered in M3-B1).

### Decision M3-3: Tabular Review is a new Skill output type, not a parallel system

Per [PRD §3.14](PRD.md#314-tabular--multi-document-review-m3): Tabular Review is "mostly a new Skill output type plus a UI surface." This is locked.

Concretely:

- Skill frontmatter gets a new field: `output_format: report | table`. Default is `report` (the current behavior).
- A `table`-output skill specifies `columns: [...]` in its frontmatter — each column is a per-row extraction query.
- The Tabular LangGraph workflow walks documents × columns, runs each cell as a Citation-Engine-verified extraction, and produces a grid.
- Skill format and skill conventions ([PRD §3.4](PRD.md#34-skill-service), [docs/skill-authoring-guide.md](skill-authoring-guide.md)) are extended in-place; no parallel "tabular skill" system.

This keeps the Skill format as the single contract for work product and means Tabular's UI surface is decoupled from its execution model — the same `output_format: table` skill could later be invoked from the Word Add-In or from the API directly.

### Decision M3-4: Slack/Teams bridges ship as optional Docker Compose profiles

The `slack-bridge` and `teams-bridge` services are **optional Docker Compose profiles** (`docker compose --profile slack up` / `--profile teams up`), not core services in the default stack. Per the existing PRD §1569 reference (`docker-compose.yml.example`) and the M1 deployment posture.

The reasoning:

- Most deployments will not enable Slack or Teams bridges. Making them optional preserves the minimal-footprint default.
- OAuth credentials for Slack/Teams are deployment-specific and operator-acquired; the off-by-default posture matches the off-by-default posture for cloud LLM provider API keys.
- The bridges are net-new services with new external trust boundaries (Slack/Teams webhooks). Off by default reduces the default attack surface.

Bot configuration lives in the LQ.AI admin UI (M3-D4), not in environment variables, so operators don't need to redeploy to change Slack/Teams config.

### Decision M3-5: Signed Word manifest — revised to community-led at PR #59 (2026-05-21)

**Original decision (M3 kickoff):** The Office.js add-in's manifest XML ships signed for enterprise sideload in v0.3 as part of M3-B7. The signing work was sized for M3 (~12–16h); cert acquisition was expected to run as a procurement task starting at M3 kickoff in parallel with M3-A code work.

**Revised at PR #59 (2026-05-21):** M3-B7 is descoped to a community-led effort per [PRD §9 DE-295](PRD.md#de-295--word-add-in-code-signing-certificate--signed-manifest-ci-community-led). v0.3.0 ships the unsigned-manifest sideload path (manifest generated via the admin UI's "Generate manifest" download); the signed distribution package lands as a community PR (likely v0.3.1 or v0.3.2) when the cert procurement completes. The reasoning for the revision:

- Code-signing certificate procurement is a real-world purchase + ongoing annual renewal. Coupling the v0.3.0 release to a procurement clock the maintainer team doesn't otherwise need to run trades release velocity for an enterprise-procurement-story gain that arrives ~2–4 weeks later regardless.
- The signed-distribution story is still committed — it just moves to a community track. SignPath's open-source sponsorship path (free for qualifying open-source projects) is the recommended first attempt; community-funded DigiCert EV / Sectigo OV are alternatives. LegalQuants, Inc. holds the legal cert artifact; the community organizes procurement + funding.
- The Microsoft 365 Admin Center sideload at v0.3.0 will show an "unsigned add-in" warning. This is acceptable for technical-savvy operators (the install path still works); enterprise procurement teams that reject unsigned add-ins wait for the v0.3.x community-led signed release.

DE-295 captures the five concrete operator-UX implications gated until M3-B7 lands. The original procurement-track guidance ("start at M3 kickoff in parallel with M3-A code work") no longer applies — it now starts when a community member files the procurement tracking issue per DE-295's Phase A.

---

## Phase 0 — Pre-M3 hardening (Week 1)

Three deferred enhancements surfaced during M2 land before the M3 tracks begin. They are small, isolated, and either (a) load-bearing for downstream M3 tracks (DE-276) or (b) easy wins worth shipping as the v0.2.x patch series before the M3 tracks open (DE-283, DE-277).

### Task M3-0.1 — DE-283: Fresh-install login UX (bootstrap-password surface)

**Scope:**
- Update the web app login surface so that a first-401 against the default admin credentials renders an informational panel pointing the operator at `docker compose logs api` for the bootstrap admin password.
- Add a `/api/v1/admin/bootstrap-status` endpoint (read-only) that returns `{ "default_password_active": bool, "logs_hint": str }` — the web app calls this on 401 to decide whether to surface the bootstrap-password hint.
- Update `docs/quickstart.md` to point at the new UX flow.
- Mark this task as community-friendly in PR template / README — first-contribution target.

**Dependencies:** None. First task in M3.

**Output:** Fresh-install operators see actionable guidance on the login screen instead of a generic 401.

**Verification:**
- Fresh-install reproduction: `docker compose down -v && docker compose up --build`; navigate to login; confirm informational panel renders correctly.
- The hint disappears once the operator has rotated the bootstrap password.
- Cypress E2E test in `web/cypress/e2e/m3-0-fresh-install-login.cy.ts` covers the first-401 path.

**Effort:** 3–4 hours.

**References:** [DE-283 in PRD §9](PRD.md#de-283--fresh-install-login-ux-surface-the-bootstrap-password-path-on-first-401).

### Task M3-0.2 — DE-277: Citation extractor chunk-boundary fallback

**Scope** (corrected to track [DE-277 in PRD §9](PRD.md#de-277--citation-extractor-fallback-to-document-scan-on-chunk-boundary-miss) verbatim — the plan's original task description placed the fix in `verification.py`, but the actual gap is in `extraction.py`'s locator):

- Extend `app/citation/extraction.py::extract_citations` with a full-document fallback. When the chunk-local locator (`_locate_in_chunk(quote, chunk.content)`) misses but the caller supplies the chunk's parent document's `normalized_content` (M2-A1 surface), retry the same exact-then-fuzzy locator against the full document.
- Resolved offsets from the document-level scan are document-absolute already (no `chunk.char_offset_start` arithmetic); the downstream verifier reads against `documents.normalized_content` so the Stage 1 / Stage 2 logic verifies spanning candidates with no change. **No new `verification_method` values are required.**
- Wire the chat-send pipeline (`app/api/chats.py::_persist_message_citations`) to pre-load documents for the retrieved-chunk doc_ids and pass the normalized-content map to `extract_citations`. The same loaded docs are reused by the verifier (no duplicate DB roundtrip).
- Emit a structured `citation_chunk_mismatch` warning when the fallback fires (per [DE-277](PRD.md#de-277--citation-extractor-fallback-to-document-scan-on-chunk-boundary-miss) option b) — the citation still verifies, but the mismatch signal is worth surfacing for aggregate observability.
- Unit tests in `api/tests/citation/test_chunk_boundary.py` covering: citation spanning two chunks; citation spanning three chunks (rare but possible for long quotes); citation entirely within one chunk (regression test — unaffected); chunk-mismatch warning emitted only on fallback path; backward compatibility when `document_contents` is not supplied.
- Flip the existing `test_edge_cases.py::test_chunk_boundary_spanning_citation_does_not_extract_today` to assert the new behavior (`verification_method='exact_match'`, document-absolute offsets persisted).

**Dependencies:** M2-A1 (normalized_content); M2-A2 (Stage 1); M2-B1 (Stage 2). All shipped at v0.2.0.

**Output:** Citations split across chunk boundaries no longer fall to Stage 3 (LLM judge) when they could be verified verbatim against the source document.

**Verification:**
- Test corpus includes citations deliberately authored across chunk boundaries; the spanning fallback resolves them.
- No regression in single-chunk verification (existing test suite passes unchanged).
- The `citation_chunk_mismatch` warning surfaces in logs / Langfuse spans when the fallback fires.

**Effort:** 4–6 hours.

**References:** [DE-277 in PRD §9](PRD.md#de-277--citation-extractor-fallback-to-document-scan-on-chunk-boundary-miss).

### Task M3-0.3 — DE-276: Ingest observability — surface silent embed/parse failures

**Scope:**
- Audit `api/app/pipeline/ingest.py` for paths where parse or embed failures are caught and logged without surfacing to the user or to a queryable surface.
- Add `documents.ingest_status TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'ok'` and `documents.ingest_failure_reason TEXT NULL` columns via migration `0030_ingest_observability.py`. Status values: `'ok'`, `'parse_failed'`, `'embed_failed'`, `'partial'`.
- Surface ingest-status in the document list UI: failed documents render with a red error badge + click-through to the failure reason.
- Add an `/api/v1/admin/ingest-health` endpoint returning aggregate counts of `ok` / `parse_failed` / `embed_failed` / `partial` documents across the deployment.
- Wire OTel span on every parse and embed call so silent failures appear in Langfuse/observability.
- Update `docs/db-schema.md` for the new columns.
- Backfill: existing documents get `ingest_status = 'ok'` by default; operators may re-run ingest on flagged docs.

**Dependencies:** None directly; load-bearing for Phase C (Tabular Review) since silent embed failures would corrupt tabular outputs.

**Output:** Operators can see which documents in their KBs are partially or fully un-ingested. Silent failures surface as alarms, not as data corruption.

**Verification:**
- Deliberately corrupt a test PDF (truncate it); re-ingest; document appears with `ingest_status = 'parse_failed'` and the failure reason in the UI.
- `GET /api/v1/admin/ingest-health` returns nonzero `parse_failed` count.
- Existing healthy documents unchanged (`ingest_status = 'ok'`).

**Effort:** 6–8 hours.

**References:** [DE-276 in PRD §9](PRD.md#de-276--ingest-observability-surface-silent-embedparse-failures).

## Phase A — Playbook engine substrate (Weeks 2–3)

The Playbook engine is the load-bearing substrate for two M3 tracks (Word Add-In uses it to execute Playbooks against open documents; Tabular Review uses the same LangGraph runtime). Phase A lands the schema, the executor, the first built-in playbook end-to-end, the execution UI, then the remaining built-ins and the Easy Playbook wizard.

### Task M3-A1 — Playbook schema + DB migrations

**Scope:**
- Alembic migration `0031_playbooks.py` adds:
  - `playbooks` (id UUID, name TEXT, contract_type TEXT, description TEXT, version TEXT, created_by UUID FK users, created_at TIMESTAMPTZ, updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ).
  - `playbook_positions` (id UUID, playbook_id UUID FK playbooks, issue TEXT, description TEXT, standard_language TEXT, fallback_tiers JSONB, redline_strategy TEXT, severity_if_missing TEXT CHECK IN ('critical','high','medium','low'), detection_keywords TEXT[], detection_examples TEXT[], position_order INT).
  - `playbook_executions` (id UUID, playbook_id UUID FK, target_document_id UUID FK documents, user_id UUID FK users, project_id UUID FK projects NULL, status TEXT, results JSONB NULL, error TEXT NULL, created_at TIMESTAMPTZ, completed_at TIMESTAMPTZ NULL).
  - Indexes: `playbook_positions(playbook_id, position_order)`; `playbook_executions(user_id, created_at DESC)`; `playbook_executions(target_document_id)`.
- Pydantic schemas in `api/app/schemas/playbooks.py` matching [PRD §3.7](PRD.md#37-playbooks) (`Playbook`, `Position`, `FallbackTier`, `PlaybookExecution`).
- SQLAlchemy models in `api/app/models/playbooks.py`.
- Update `docs/db-schema.md` for the three new tables.

**Dependencies:** Phase 0 complete.

**Output:** Playbook data substrate exists; no executor yet.

**Verification:**
- `alembic upgrade head` runs cleanly against a fresh DB.
- `pytest api/tests/models/test_playbook_models.py` covers CRUD round-trip.
- OpenAPI conformance test holds (no schemas added that aren't referenced).

**Effort:** 4–6 hours.

### Task M3-A2 — LangGraph runtime + Playbook executor skeleton

**Scope:**
- Add `langgraph ~= 0.2` to `api/pyproject.toml`. Pin a version; SBOM-relevant.
- Create `api/app/playbooks/` module:
  - `__init__.py`
  - `executor.py` — LangGraph-based `PlaybookExecutor` class.
  - `nodes.py` — individual LangGraph nodes (retrieve, classify, redline, compile).
  - `state.py` — `PlaybookExecutionState` typed dict.
- Implement the four-step executor per [PRD §3.7 Playbook execution](PRD.md#37-playbooks):
  1. **Parse target contract** — fetch document via existing Document Pipeline; obtain chunks.
  2. **Retrieve matching clause(s)** — per Playbook position, hybrid-search the target contract for the position's `detection_keywords` + `detection_examples`. Return top-k chunks per position.
  3. **Classify** — for each position, run a structured-output LLM call: `matches_standard | matches_fallback_tier_N | deviates | missing`. Uses the same Inference Gateway as chat; respects the project's `minimum_inference_tier` and `ensemble_verification` flags.
  4. **Draft redlines** — for `deviates` results, draft a redline using the position's `redline_strategy` template. Structured output: `{old_text, new_text, justification}`.
- Citation Engine integration: every `matches_standard` / `matches_fallback_tier_N` / `deviates` classification cites the chunk(s) it matched against; the Citation Engine verifies them (Stages 1–4 as configured).
- Persist `PlaybookExecution.results` as JSONB with the full per-position outcome.
- API endpoints (subset, per [PRD §3.7](PRD.md#37-playbooks)):
  - `POST /api/v1/playbooks/{id}/execute` — kicks off execution; returns 202 with execution_id.
  - `GET /api/v1/playbook-executions/{id}` — returns execution state + results.
- Unit tests in `api/tests/playbooks/test_executor.py` against a small synthetic playbook and a tiny doc.
- Update `docs/api/backend-openapi.yaml` for the new endpoints.

**Dependencies:** M3-A1.

**Output:** Playbook executor runs end-to-end against synthetic inputs. No UI yet; tested via API.

**Verification:**
- Synthetic test: create a tiny NDA-shaped doc, a single-position playbook, kick off execution, poll for completion, verify the position is classified.
- Verify Citation Engine integration: classifications cite chunks, citations pass verification.
- Failed-execution path: missing document or unknown playbook returns 404 cleanly; in-flight error sets `status = 'error'` and persists `error` field.

**Effort:** 12–16 hours.

---

### Task M3-A3 — First built-in playbook: NDA (mutual + unilateral variants)

**Scope:**
- Author `skills/playbooks/nda/playbook.yaml` (mutual variant) and `skills/playbooks/nda-unilateral/playbook.yaml` (unilateral variant).
- Each playbook covers the standard NDA position set:
  - Definition of confidential information
  - Permitted disclosures (legal counsel, regulators, affiliates)
  - Duration / term
  - Survival of confidentiality obligations
  - Carveouts (independently developed, publicly known, lawfully obtained)
  - Remedies / injunctive relief
  - Governing law / venue
  - Return / destruction of confidential information
- Each position has `standard_language`, ≥2 `fallback_tiers`, `redline_strategy`, `severity_if_missing`, `detection_keywords`, `detection_examples`.
- Practicing-attorney attestation per [skills/CONTRIBUTING.md](../skills/CONTRIBUTING.md) — built-in playbooks follow the same attestation path as skills containing legal substance.
- Seed migration `0032_seed_builtin_playbooks_nda.py` inserts both NDA playbooks into the `playbooks` and `playbook_positions` tables at version `1.0.0`.
- Integration test: run NDA playbook against the sample NDA shipped in M1 fixtures; assert each position is classified.

**Dependencies:** M3-A2.

**Output:** First built-in playbook executes end-to-end. Validates the Playbook authoring conventions before scaling to 3 more.

**Verification:**
- Practicing-attorney attestation in PR description.
- Integration test passes.
- Manual walk-through: maintainer + reviewing attorney run NDA playbook on 3 real-world sample NDAs; outcomes are sensible.

**Effort:** 8–10 hours.

---

### Task M3-A4 — Playbook execution UI in web app — **SHIPPED at M3-A4**

**Scope:**
- New SvelteKit route in `web/src/routes/lq-ai/playbooks/` for:
  - Playbook list view: `/lq-ai/playbooks` — shows available playbooks with contract_type + version + author.
  - Playbook execution flow: from a document (or Project file), "Apply Playbook" action opens a playbook picker; selecting a playbook + confirming kicks off execution.
  - Execution result view: `/lq-ai/playbook-executions/[id]` — renders the per-position outcome with the standard language, the contract's language, the assessment, and the suggested redline. Citations render in the existing 5-state Citation Engine UI (M2-C2).
- Bulk position view: collapsed-by-default per-position cards; expand to see standard + actual + redline.
- Filter UI: filter positions by severity (`critical` / `high` / `medium` / `low`) and by outcome (`matches` / `deviates` / `missing`).
- Cost preview before execution (estimated tokens × per-model rate, per M2-E2 cost calibration surface): show "Estimated cost: $X.XX" and a confirm step.
- Cypress E2E test in `web/cypress/e2e/m3-a-playbook-execution.cy.ts` covers: select doc → select playbook → preview cost → confirm → see results.

**Dependencies:** M3-A3.

**Output:** Operators can run a built-in playbook against a document in the web app and see structured results with citations.

**Verification:**
- Cypress E2E passes.
- Visual review: result view is legible; the per-position card layout supports an attorney walking through a 30-position contract review without cognitive overload.
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for color/contrast on outcome badges.

**Effort:** 12–16 hours.

**Implementation deviations from original scope (recorded for M3 milestone summary):**
- §5.1 — `GET /api/v1/playbooks` + `GET /api/v1/playbooks/{id}` ship with M3-A4; `POST/PATCH/DELETE` defer to M3-A6 alongside the Easy Playbook wizard's create flow.
- §5.2 — Cost preview is client-side against a static `PER_MODEL_RATES` table (`web/src/lib/lq-ai/playbookCost.ts`); a server-side cost-estimate endpoint was not added.
- §5.3 — `PlaybookDisclaimerBanner.svelte` ships in M3-A4 (Decision F implication); CONTRIBUTING.md + PRD §1.3 attestation refresh still defer to the M3-close docs batch.
- §5.4 — Result view uses dense rows + expand-to-reveal (table-style), not full-width vertical cards.
- Apply-Playbook entry point is from `/lq-ai/playbooks` (playbook → pick doc), not from a document's context menu. Doc-context entry point deferred to M3-A6.
- Citation Engine integration: per-position `cited_chunk_ids` render as chunk-id pills; full Stage 1–4 5-state UI integration deferred (the existing Citation Engine UI uses continuous relevance percentage, not 5 discrete states — gap surfaced during reconnaissance).
- Backend follow-on: exposed `KBFileResponse.document_id` (the parsed-content row UUID, distinct from File id) so the modal's KB→file picker can resolve `target_document_id` client-side. 4-file change covering schema, query, TS type, OpenAPI.

**Deferred items filed as M3-A4 follow-ons** (track in M3 milestone summary):
- DE — Playbook position citations: open-in-document drilldown (Citation Engine 5-state coloring against `cited_chunk_ids`).
- DE — Apply-Playbook from document context menu (M3-A6 candidate).
- DE — Automated WCAG audit tooling (no a11y ESLint plugin in the codebase today; M3-A4 verified manually via browser devtools).

---

### Task M3-A5 — Remaining 3 built-in playbooks (MSA-SaaS, DPA, Commercial MSA)

**Scope:**
- Author `skills/playbooks/msa-saas/playbook.yaml` — Generic SaaS MSA playbook; covers SLA, security commitments, data handling, IP, limitation of liability, indemnification, termination, audit rights, payment terms, governing law, change management.
- Author `skills/playbooks/dpa-gdpr/playbook.yaml` — DPA (GDPR-aligned) playbook; covers Art. 28 (processor obligations), Art. 32 (security), Art. 33 (breach notification), international transfers (SCCs / TIA), sub-processor handling, audit rights, deletion / return of personal data, DSAR cooperation.
- Author `skills/playbooks/msa-commercial-purchase/playbook.yaml` — Commercial MSA from purchase side; covers acceptance, warranties, indemnification, limitation of liability, IP, change orders, payment, termination for cause/convenience, governing law.
- Each playbook carries the standard not-legal-advice disclaimer in its `description` field (Decision F locked at M3-A3 kickoff; the `test_description_includes_not_legal_advice_disclaimer` pattern from M3-A3 generalizes to each new playbook).
- Seed migration `0033_seed_builtin_playbooks_msa_dpa.py` inserts all three at version `1.0.0`, following the M3-A3 pattern of reading the YAML files at upgrade time.
- Each gets one integration test against a representative sample contract in `api/tests/fixtures/`. Sample contracts sourced from public-domain templates (Common Paper CC-BY-4.0, EU Commission SCCs, etc.) with attribution.

**Dependencies:** M3-A4 (validates the end-to-end flow before scaling).

**Output:** 4 built-in playbooks total are available out-of-the-box (NDA × 2 from M3-A3 + MSA-SaaS + DPA-GDPR + MSA-Commercial-Purchase).

**Verification:**
- Each playbook integration test passes.
- Each playbook's description includes the not-legal-advice disclaimer (pinned by test).
- Manual sanity check by Kevin against ≥1 representative sample contract per playbook; outcomes are plausible. Not a formal practicing-attorney attestation per Decision F — the disclaimer-in-description is the canonical posture and operators are expected to apply their own professional judgment.

**Effort:** 12–16 hours (~80% legal-content drafting, ~20% engineering scaffold).

---

### Task M3-A6 — Easy Playbook auto-generation wizard

**Scope:**
- New SvelteKit route `web/src/routes/lq-ai/playbooks/easy/` for the wizard:
  - Step 1: upload 5–20 prior agreements of the same contract type (limit to a single contract_type per wizard run).
  - Step 2: progress UI while the system extracts clauses, clusters by issue, identifies the user's most-common positions.
  - Step 3: review draft — wizard presents a draft playbook with suggested standard language and fallback tiers; user edits inline.
  - Step 4: approve — wizard creates a new Playbook in the operator's library.
- Backend: `POST /api/v1/playbooks/easy` starts generation; `GET /api/v1/playbooks/easy/{id}` polls status. Implementation:
  - Document parsing (existing Document Pipeline).
  - Clause extraction via a `playbook-easy-extract` skill (treats each contract as the input, returns structured clauses by issue type).
  - Clustering: embedding-based clustering of like-clauses across the corpus; identify the user's modal position per issue.
  - Draft assembly: standard_language from the modal position; fallback_tiers from neighboring cluster centers.
- Per [PRD §3.7 NFR](PRD.md#37-playbooks): "Easy Playbook generation from 10 prior agreements: < 10 minutes."
- Practicing-attorney review of the wizard's output quality on a curated test corpus before this task closes.

**Dependencies:** M3-A5.

**Output:** Users can upload prior agreements and get a drafted custom playbook for review and editing.

**Verification:**
- Generate a custom NDA playbook from a corpus of 10 sample NDAs; compare to the built-in NDA playbook; verify the output is plausible (similar position structure, sensible standard_language).
- Latency budget met: 10-doc generation completes in < 10 minutes against the dev-mode default model alias.
- Reviewing-attorney walk-through confirms the output is starting-point-quality (the user is expected to edit, not accept verbatim).

**Effort:** 14–18 hours.

## Phase B — Word Add-In (Weeks 4–5)

The Word Add-In brings LQ.AI capabilities into Microsoft Word as an Office.js task pane. Phase B's **shipping plumbing in M3** (M3-B1 scaffold + M3-B2 OAuth + M3-B8 self-hosted JS bundle + version handshake) produces an installable, authenticated add-in distributable via Microsoft 365 Admin Center via the **unsigned-manifest** path. Two parallel scope-reductions land at v0.3.0:

1. **The feature surface inside the task pane** (M3-B3 chat, M3-B4 skills with tracked-changes + comments rendering, M3-B5 playbook execution, M3-B6 Inference Tier badge) is descoped to M4 / community contribution per the 2026-05-21 close-out decision at the M3-A6 PR #57 close; see [PRD §9 DE-287](PRD.md#de-287--word-add-in-feature-surface-chat-skills-playbooks-tier-badge--deferred-to-m4--community-contribution).
2. **M3-B7 (signed manifest + enterprise distribution package)** is descoped to a **community-led effort** per the 2026-05-21 PR #59 decision. Code-signing certificate procurement is real-world purchase + ongoing renewal work that couples the project's release cadence to a multi-week procurement clock; treating it as maintainer work overconstrains M3. The community organizes the procurement + funding (SignPath open-source sponsorship is the recommended first path; community-funded DigiCert EV or Sectigo OV are alternatives), LegalQuants holds the legal cert artifact, and the signing CI lands as a community PR once the cert is in hand. See [PRD §9 DE-295](PRD.md#de-295--word-add-in-code-signing-certificate--signed-manifest-ci-community-led) for the procurement plan + the v0.3.x → v0.3.y community-led signing rollout.

Each descoped task below carries an inline status marker and retains its original scope text so a contributor picking up the work can claim it as a standalone PR against the plumbing.

**Note for the contributor:** the `word-addin/` directory does not yet exist. M3-B1 is the first task to create it. Office.js development tooling (Node 18+, the `office-addin-debugging` toolchain, a Word client for testing) must be set up before this phase begins.

### Task M3-B1 — Word add-in scaffold (manifest + task pane shell)

**Scope:**
- Create `word-addin/` directory with the Office.js standard structure:
  - `manifest.xml` — Office add-in manifest. Targets Word; declares OAuth scopes; references task pane HTML/JS at `{deployment_origin}/word-addin/taskpane.html`.
  - `src/taskpane/` — React 18 + TypeScript task pane shell. Office.js add-in convention is React; this is the **single allowed exception to the no-React-in-`web/` rule** ([CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md)) because Word add-ins are Microsoft-conventionally React.
  - `src/commands/` — Office.js commands (toolbar buttons).
  - `webpack.config.js` — bundles the add-in JS.
  - `package.json` — pins Office.js, React, TypeScript versions.
- Task pane UI shell: header (LQ.AI logo + Inference Tier badge placeholder), tab strip (Chat / Skills / Playbooks), empty content area.
- Manifest generation: a new admin UI flow at `/lq-ai/admin/word-addin` produces a deployment-specific `manifest.xml` with the operator's deployment URL injected. This is the manifest the operator distributes via M365 Admin Center.
- `web/src/routes/word-addin/` SvelteKit route serves the task pane HTML + the bundled JS (per M3-2). The route is unauthenticated for the bundle JS; OAuth happens in M3-B2.
- Update `docker-compose.yml.example` to mount the `word-addin/dist/` directory into the web container's static-files path.
- Update `docs/architecture.md` with the Word add-in in the system diagram.

**Dependencies:** Phase 0 complete. Phase A is **not** a hard dependency — the Word add-in can scaffold in parallel with Phase A's Playbook engine work in calendar terms, but no code in B depends on A landing until M3-B5.

**Output:** The Word add-in loads in Word desktop with an empty task pane. Manifest can be generated per deployment.

**Verification:**
- Manual: sideload the dev manifest in Word desktop; task pane opens with the shell UI.
- The bundled JS is served by the LQ.AI deployment, not from any external host.
- Manifest XSD validates against Microsoft's schema (`office-addin-manifest validate`).

**Effort:** 10–12 hours.

---

### Task M3-B2 — Add-in ↔ backend authentication (OAuth)

**Scope:**
- Implement OAuth flow between the Word add-in and the LQ.AI deployment.
- The add-in opens an OAuth popup against `{deployment_origin}/oauth/authorize?client_id=word-addin&redirect_uri=...`; backend issues a token; add-in stores the token in `Office.context.officeRuntime.auth` (Microsoft's recommended pattern for add-ins).
- Backend changes:
  - Register `word-addin` as a built-in OAuth client (no client secret; uses PKCE).
  - Token issuance respects the user's existing LQ.AI identity (the add-in's OAuth flow logs the user into LQ.AI in the popup, then issues a token bound to that user).
  - Tokens are scoped (add-in can't access admin endpoints).
- Update `docs/api/backend-openapi.yaml` for the OAuth endpoints.
- E2E test: configure a test user; trigger the add-in's OAuth flow against a local dev deployment; verify the token works against `GET /api/v1/users/me`.

**Dependencies:** M3-B1.

**Output:** The add-in authenticates against the LQ.AI deployment as the same user who would log into the web app.

**Verification:**
- Manual E2E: sideload manifest → open task pane → click "Sign in" → OAuth popup → token stored → user-info request succeeds.
- Token-revocation path: revoke the token via the admin UI; subsequent add-in requests return 401; add-in surfaces a "sign in again" prompt.
- Security review per CODEOWNERS — touches auth.

**Effort:** 10–12 hours.

---

### Task M3-B3 — Chat against the open document

**Status:** **Descoped to M4 / community contribution** per [PRD §9 DE-287](PRD.md#de-287--word-add-in-feature-surface-chat-skills-playbooks-tier-badge--deferred-to-m4--community-contribution). Scope retained below for a contributor claiming the task.

**Scope:**
- Task pane Chat tab: chat UI that mirrors the web app's chat UI, scaled for the narrower task pane.
- "Open document context" toggle: when on, the contents of the open Word document are passed as initial context to the chat (the document is treated as an attached file).
- Selection-only context: when text is selected in Word, a "Use selection" affordance attaches just the selected text as context.
- Chat backend: the add-in calls the same `/api/v1/chat/completions` endpoint as the web app; no new backend endpoint.
- Streaming responses render progressively in the task pane.
- Citations render with the same 5-state UI (verified / verified-tolerant / verified-paraphrase / unverified / system-error) as the web app — citation interaction in the add-in highlights the cited span in the Word document body via Office.js range APIs.

**Dependencies:** M3-B2.

**Output:** Users can chat with LQ.AI inside Word using the open document or a selection as context. Citations link back to spans in the doc.

**Verification:**
- Manual E2E: open a 5-page sample contract in Word; ask "what is the indemnification cap?"; verify the answer streams; verify citations highlight the right span when clicked.
- Selection-only path: select a single clause; ask "is this favorable to us?"; verify only the selected clause is in context.

**Effort:** 8–10 hours.

---

### Task M3-B4 — Skills in Word (apply skill to selection or document)

**Status:** **Descoped to M4 / community contribution** per [PRD §9 DE-287](PRD.md#de-287--word-add-in-feature-surface-chat-skills-playbooks-tier-badge--deferred-to-m4--community-contribution). Scope retained below for a contributor claiming the task.

**Scope:**
- Task pane Skills tab: list of available skills (from `GET /api/v1/skills`).
- "Apply skill" flow:
  - User picks a skill (e.g., `nda-review`).
  - User chooses scope: whole document, or current selection.
  - Add-in calls `POST /api/v1/skills/{id}/execute` with the document (or selection) as input.
  - Result renders in the task pane with the same 5-state Citation Engine UI.
- Result post-processing for Word:
  - Skill-generated **redlines** → applied as Word **tracked changes** via Office.js (`Word.Range.insertText`, `Word.Range.delete` within a tracked-changes session).
  - Skill-generated **assessments** → applied as Word **comments** via `Word.Range.insertComment`.
  - Skill output that is descriptive text (not redline / not comment) renders in the task pane only.
- Inference Tier badge in the task pane: reflects the routed tier for the skill's underlying chat (per §3.13).

**Dependencies:** M3-B3.

**Output:** Skills run from Word against the open doc; redlines appear as tracked changes; comments appear as Word comments; users see citations in the task pane.

**Verification:**
- Manual E2E: open a sample NDA in Word; run the `nda-review` skill; verify tracked-changes appear for redline suggestions; verify comments appear for assessments; verify citations render correctly.
- The user can review/accept/reject the tracked changes using Word's native review tools.
- The Inference Tier badge reflects the actual tier used.

**Effort:** 12–16 hours.

---

### Task M3-B5 — Playbook execution in Word

**Status:** **Descoped to M4 / community contribution** per [PRD §9 DE-287](PRD.md#de-287--word-add-in-feature-surface-chat-skills-playbooks-tier-badge--deferred-to-m4--community-contribution). Scope retained below for a contributor claiming the task.

**Scope:**
- Task pane Playbooks tab: list of playbooks (built-in + user-created).
- "Apply playbook" flow:
  - User picks a playbook.
  - User confirms cost preview.
  - Add-in calls `POST /api/v1/playbooks/{id}/execute` with the open document.
  - Progress UI updates as positions complete (the executor streams per-position results via SSE).
- Render Playbook results in Word:
  - Per-position assessment → Word comment at the matching clause location (using Office.js range APIs against the cited chunks).
  - Per-position suggested redline → Word tracked change.
  - Position summary card in the task pane: standard language vs. actual vs. assessment, with click-through to the in-doc comment.
- Filter / collapse positions by severity (matches web UI of M3-A4).

**Dependencies:** M3-A4 (Playbook execution UI in web app, validates the result-rendering surface); M3-B4 (tracked-changes + comments infrastructure).

**Output:** Operators can run a Playbook against the open Word document and see comments + tracked changes applied directly in Word.

**Verification:**
- Manual E2E with a reviewing attorney: open a sample MSA; run the MSA-SaaS playbook; verify position-level comments and tracked changes appear at the right locations; verify the per-position summary in the task pane matches what's in Word.

**Effort:** 10–12 hours.

---

### Task M3-B6 — Inference Tier badge in task pane [parallel with M3-B5]

**Status:** **Descoped to M4 / community contribution** per [PRD §9 DE-287](PRD.md#de-287--word-add-in-feature-surface-chat-skills-playbooks-tier-badge--deferred-to-m4--community-contribution). Scope retained below for a contributor claiming the task.

**Scope:**
- Add Inference Tier badge to the task pane header (matches the web app's badge per [PRD §3.13](PRD.md#313-inference-tier-awareness)).
- Click-through opens the same tier-detail panel UI the web app uses (reuse the web app's component if practical; otherwise re-implement against the same `/api/v1/inference-tier-detail` endpoint).
- The badge reflects the active chat's effective tier (per [PRD §3.8 ensemble](PRD.md#38-multi-model-ensemble-verification): minimum tier across the ensemble).
- For Playbook executions and skill applications, the badge updates to reflect the tier for that operation.

**Dependencies:** M3-B4. Parallel with M3-B5 in calendar terms.

**Output:** Word add-in users see the same tier-awareness signal as web app users.

**Verification:**
- Switch the deployment's model routing between Tier 1 (local) and Tier 3 (cloud); verify the badge updates.
- Click-through opens the tier-detail panel correctly.

**Effort:** 4–6 hours.

---

### Task M3-B7 — Signed manifest + enterprise sideload distribution package

**Status:** **Descoped to community-led effort** per [PRD §9 DE-295](PRD.md#de-295--word-add-in-code-signing-certificate--signed-manifest-ci-community-led). v0.3.0 ships the unsigned-manifest sideload path (manifest generated via the admin UI at `/lq-ai/admin/word-addin`); Microsoft 365 Admin Center will show an "unsigned add-in" warning during sideload until M3-B7 lands. The signing CI + signed distribution package land as a community PR when the code-signing cert procurement completes. Scope retained below for the community contributor claiming the task.

**Scope:**
- Acquire a code-signing certificate. **Community-led** per DE-295. Three credible paths: SignPath open-source sponsorship (free for qualifying open-source projects; recommended), community-funded DigiCert EV (~$500–700/yr; HSM/USB token; fastest SmartScreen warmup), or community-funded Sectigo OV (~$200–300/yr; longer SmartScreen warmup). The cert is issued to **LegalQuants, Inc.** (the legal entity that publishes the add-in); a community member walks the procurement + funding mechanism.
- Wire signing into CI:
  - GitHub Actions workflow `.github/workflows/word-addin-release.yml` signs `manifest.xml` and the bundled JS on every release tag.
  - Cert + private key stored as GitHub Actions secrets (or accessed via the SignPath API if that path is chosen); manifest signing happens in a hardened workflow gated to the `release` environment.
- Produce a distribution package:
  - `word-addin-v0.3.x.zip` containing the signed manifest + a README with M365 Admin Center sideload instructions.
  - Released as a GitHub Release asset on the release tag.
- Update M3-B8's version-handshake handler to populate the `taskpane_bundle_hash` field from the signing CI's build manifest (it ships nullable in v0.3.0; this completes the M3-B8 contract).
- Create `docs/security/word-addin.md` covering: signing chain of trust, what the operator should verify before deploying (e.g., `signtool verify /pa manifest.xml`), threat model boundaries (the add-in runs in Office's web sandbox; it cannot access local files outside the document; it cannot call the LQ.AI backend without an OAuth token).
- Security review per CODEOWNERS — touches signing infrastructure.

**Dependencies:** v0.3.0 shipped with the unsigned-manifest path (this M3 PR). Cert procurement complete (community Phase A per DE-295).

**Output:** Operators can download `word-addin-v0.3.x.zip`, verify the signature, and sideload via M365 Admin Center without the "unsigned add-in" warning.

**Verification:**
- Manifest signature verifies against the issuing cert.
- Sideloaded add-in works against a real LQ.AI deployment in Word desktop, Word Online, and Word for iPad.
- Security reviewer signs off on the signing chain.

**Effort:** 12–16 hours of community implementation work after the cert is in hand, plus the procurement timeline (typically 2–4 weeks for SignPath open-source approval; 1–3 weeks for a community-funded paid cert).

---

### Task M3-B8 — Self-hosted add-in JS bundle serving + version handshake

**Scope:**
- Wire the add-in JS bundle to be served by the LQ.AI deployment's `web/` SvelteKit app at `{deployment_origin}/word-addin/taskpane.html` (per M3-2).
- Add a version-handshake on add-in load: the add-in fetches `/api/v1/version` and compares its bundled version against the deployment's; if mismatched, surfaces a "Reload the add-in" prompt (avoids the v0.3 add-in talking to a v0.4 backend).
- Update `docs/deploy/` operator guide for the Word Add-In: how to enable, how to generate the deployment-specific manifest, how to distribute via M365 Admin Center.

**Dependencies:** M3-B2 (OAuth). The original plan listed M3-B7 as a dependency, but the M3 scope of B8 (self-served bundle + version handshake) doesn't require the signed-manifest CI to land first — the version handshake endpoint and the task-pane mount-time check operate the same way for both signed and unsigned manifests. M3-B7 (now community-led per [DE-295](PRD.md#de-295--word-add-in-code-signing-certificate--signed-manifest-ci-community-led)) will populate the `taskpane_bundle_hash` field that M3-B8 ships nullable.

**Output:** A self-hosted LQ.AI deployment serves its own Word add-in bundle. No external CDN dependency.

**Verification:**
- Fresh-install test: `docker compose down -v && docker compose up --build`; sideload the generated manifest; add-in loads, authenticates, and runs end-to-end.
- Version-skew test: deliberately serve a stale bundle; verify the handshake prompt appears.

**Effort:** 4–6 hours.

---

## Phase C — Tabular / Multi-Document Review (Week 6)

Tabular Review is the second consumer of the LangGraph runtime landed in Phase A. It introduces a new Skill `output_format: table` mode plus a tabular UI surface; bulk operations and XLSX/CSV export round it out.

### Task M3-C1 — `output_format: table` Skill mode

**Scope:**
- Extend the Skill frontmatter schema to support `output_format: report | table` (`report` is the existing default, backward-compatible).
- For `output_format: table` skills, frontmatter adds:
  - `columns: [{name: str, query: str, ensemble_verification: bool}]` — each column is a per-row extraction query; ensemble is optionally on by default for high-stakes columns.
- Update `docs/skill-authoring-guide.md` and [PRD §3.4](PRD.md#34-skill-service) to document the `table` mode.
- Extend the skill-schema validator in `api/app/skills/schema.py` (existing module; no new `validators.py`) to enforce the new fields via a Pydantic `model_validator` on `LQAIFrontmatter`.
- Authoring conventions: a `table`-mode skill cannot specify `output_format` and `report`-mode output in the same skill — they are mutually exclusive.

**Dependencies:** Phase 0 + Phase A (LangGraph runtime).

**Output:** The Skill format supports a new `table` output mode. No execution yet; that's M3-C2.

**Verification:**
- Schema validator rejects malformed `table` skills (missing `columns`, columns without `query`).
- Existing `report` skills unchanged; regression test passes.

**Effort:** 6–8 hours.

---

### Task M3-C2 — Tabular Review LangGraph workflow

**Scope:**
- Create `api/app/tabular/` module:
  - `executor.py` — LangGraph workflow that walks documents × columns.
  - `nodes.py` — extraction node (per cell), aggregation node, citation-verification integration.
- Workflow:
  1. Input: a set of documents (Knowledge Base, Project files, or free selection) + a tabular skill (or ad-hoc columns).
  2. For each `(document, column)` pair, run the column's `query` as a citation-grounded extraction against the document. Returns `{value: str, citations: [Citation], confidence: 'high'|'medium'|'low', error: str|None}`.
  3. Aggregate into a grid: rows = documents, columns = column-names.
  4. Cells with failed extraction render as "not found" with a "verify" affordance — never as confident wrong text (matches Citation Engine state model).
- API endpoints:
  - `POST /api/v1/tabular/execute` — kicks off execution; returns 202 with `tabular_execution_id`.
  - `GET /api/v1/tabular/executions/{id}` — returns state + grid.
- Migration `0034_tabular_executions.py` adds `tabular_executions` table (id, user_id, status, document_ids JSONB, skill_id NULL, columns JSONB, results JSONB NULL, created_at, completed_at).
- Cost preview: before execution, return `{estimated_tokens, estimated_cost}` per the cost-calibration surface (M2-E2). User confirms before kickoff.

**Dependencies:** M3-C1.

**Output:** Tabular extractions run end-to-end against arbitrary document sets and column specs.

**Verification:**
- Sample: 5 NDAs × 4 columns (term, survival, carveouts, governing-law); execution completes; grid renders with citations per cell.
- Failed-cell path: deliberately ask a column-query that can't be answered from a doc; cell renders as "not found", not as confident wrong text.

**Effort:** 12–16 hours.

---

### Task M3-C3 — Tabular UI surface

**Scope:**
- New SvelteKit route `web/src/routes/lq-ai/tabular/`:
  - Selection step: pick documents (KB / Project files / individual files) and columns (saved tabular skill, or ad-hoc).
  - Cost preview step: shows estimated cost; user confirms.
  - Execution step: progressive grid renders as cells complete.
  - Result step: full grid view with each cell linking to the cited chunk(s) in the source document (opens the existing citation viewer side panel).
- Grid UX:
  - Sticky first column (document name) and first row (column names).
  - Cells render the extracted value + a confidence chip (matches Citation Engine's `high|medium|low` model).
  - Click a cell: side panel opens with the source document + highlighted citation spans.
- Cypress E2E test in `web/cypress/e2e/m3-c-tabular-review.cy.ts`.

**Dependencies:** M3-C2.

**Output:** Users run tabular extractions in the web app with a familiar grid + citation surface.

**Verification:**
- Cypress E2E passes.
- Visual review: 30-row × 5-column grid renders without performance regression.
- Cell-to-citation linkage works for all cell states (verified, partial, unverified).

**Effort:** 10–14 hours.

---

### Task M3-C4 — XLSX/CSV export (M3 scope) — **SHIPPED at M3-C4a**

**Status revision (2026-05-22, post-M3-C3 close):** the original spec bundled XLSX/CSV export with bulk operations ("Redline column N in all rows", "Draft memo summarizing column N"). Bulk operations is **descoped to post-M3** per [DE-304](PRD.md#de-304--tabular-review-bulk-operations-redline-per-row--summarize-column-deferred-from-m3-c4) — the architecture decisions on output pattern (new grid columns vs N new chats vs combined report view; new artifact type vs chat message vs markdown download) warrant a design conversation before code lands. M3-C4 ships export-only at v0.3.0.

**Scope (M3-C4a — what shipped):**
- Endpoint: `GET /api/v1/tabular/executions/{id}/export?format=xlsx|csv` — streams the file. 409 on non-completed executions. Audit row written on every export.
- XLSX export — uses `openpyxl` (`>=3.1,<4`, added at this task). Each cell with at least one citation carries an openpyxl `Comment` listing citation IDs + confidences (cap of 5 per comment with `... and N more` overflow line; lead line preserves total). Header row matches column names.
- CSV export — uses stdlib `csv` (no pandas dependency). Citations flattened to a trailing `citation_links` column with semicolon-separated `<column_name>:<citation_id>` pairs.
- Failed cells render as `"(failed)"` in both formats so the gap is visible in the spreadsheet without consulting the source execution.

**Scope (M3-C4b — descoped to DE-304):**
- "Redline column N in all rows" — runs an `output_format: report` skill per row.
- "Draft memo summarizing column N" — runs a summary skill against the column's values.

**Dependencies:** M3-C3.

**Output:** Operators can take the tabular result downstream in their existing Excel / spreadsheet workflows. Bulk operations land post-M3 once the output pattern is locked.

**Verification:**
- XLSX export opens cleanly in Excel desktop, Numbers (macOS), and Google Sheets — verified by inspection on the synthetic NDA + MSA corpora during M3-C4a.
- CSV export round-trips through stdlib `csv.reader` (the pandas roundtrip in the original spec was replaced by stdlib-only verification to avoid adding pandas to the api SBOM).
- Citation links in the XLSX comments contain the citation IDs and confidence values; clickable deep-links from the comment to the deployment URL is a deferred enhancement (filed implicitly under DE-304's design conversation).

**Effort:** 8–10 hours total estimate. M3-C4a's export-only landed in ~5 hr. M3-C4b is ~3–4 hr code + ~1–2 hr design conversation, deferred to v0.4 per DE-304.

## Phase D — Slack / Teams Light Intake Bridge (Weeks 7–8)

The smallest and most independent track. Phase D's plumbing (M3-D1 slack-bridge + OAuth install, M3-D3 teams-bridge + OAuth install, M3-D4 admin UI bot configuration) ships in M3. The user-facing `/lq` slash command and its Teams parity (M3-D2 and the equivalent surface inside M3-D3) are **descoped to M4 / community contribution** per the 2026-05-21 scope-reduction decision at the M3-A6 PR #57 close; see [PRD §9 DE-288](PRD.md#de-288--slackteams-lq-slash-command--quick-skill-flow--deferred-to-m4--community-contribution). The bridges are installable and OAuth-bound at v0.3.0 but inert without the slash-command surface; a community contributor can claim the slash-command surface as a follow-up PR.

### Task M3-D1 — `slack-bridge` service + OAuth install flow

**Scope:**
- New service: `slack-bridge/` Python (FastAPI) service running on its own port.
- New Docker Compose profile in `docker-compose.yml.example`:
  ```yaml
  slack-bridge:
    profiles: ["slack"]
    image: lq-ai/slack-bridge:${VERSION}
    environment:
      SLACK_CLIENT_ID: ${SLACK_CLIENT_ID}
      SLACK_CLIENT_SECRET: ${SLACK_CLIENT_SECRET}
      SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET: ${SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET}
      LQ_AI_BACKEND_URL: http://api:8000
      LQ_AI_BRIDGE_TOKEN: ${LQ_AI_BRIDGE_TOKEN}
  ```
- OAuth flow:
  - Admin clicks "Install Slack bridge" in LQ.AI admin UI → opens Slack's OAuth consent page → callback to `/slack/oauth/callback` on the bridge → bridge persists the workspace's bot token in the LQ.AI backend (encrypted, per existing secret-management conventions).
- Permission model: bot can only post in channels it is invited to; bot does not read silent channels.
- Slack manifest YAML at `slack-bridge/manifest.yml` for the Slack App configuration.
- Security review per CODEOWNERS — touches auth and an external trust boundary.

**Dependencies:** Phase 0; **NOT** Phase A, B, or C — Slack/Teams bridge is largely independent.

**Output:** Operators can install the Slack bridge into their Slack workspace via OAuth.

**Verification:**
- Manual E2E: spin up a dev LQ.AI deployment; install the Slack app in a test workspace; verify the bot appears in the workspace and the workspace's bot token persists.
- Security reviewer signs off.

**Effort:** 8–12 hours.

---

### Task M3-D2 — `/lq` slash command + `/lq ask` quick-skill flow

**Status:** **Descoped to M4 / community contribution** per [PRD §9 DE-288](PRD.md#de-288--slackteams-lq-slash-command--quick-skill-flow--deferred-to-m4--community-contribution). The plumbing tasks (M3-D1 Slack OAuth, M3-D3 Teams OAuth, M3-D4 admin UI) remain in M3 scope; this user-facing surface and its Teams mirror are deferred to M4 / community contribution. Scope retained below for a contributor claiming the task.

**Scope:**
- Implement two Slack slash command flows in the `slack-bridge` service:
  - `/lq` (no arg) on a thread or message: forwards the thread's content as the seed of a new LQ.AI chat. The bot replies in-thread with a link to the chat in the LQ.AI web app.
  - `/lq ask "<question>"` — runs a configured Org-Profile quick-ask skill (configurable via the LQ.AI admin UI; default is a `quick-legal-question` skill) against the question. Replies in-thread with the answer + a link to open the chat in the web app for deeper engagement.
- The user-to-LQ.AI identity mapping: the Slack user's email must match an LQ.AI user's email; if no match, the bot replies in-thread with a "Your Slack account isn't linked to LQ.AI — ask your admin" message.
- Confidentiality: thread contents are stored in LQ.AI under the linked user's chat history, with the same RBAC as any other chat.

**Dependencies:** M3-D1.

**Output:** Slack users can summon LQ.AI from their existing thread workflows.

**Verification:**
- Manual E2E with two test users (one linked, one unlinked): both `/lq` flows; both reply in-thread; linked user sees a working LQ.AI chat; unlinked user sees the link-your-account message.
- Cost-accounting integration: replies through the bridge appear in the operator's cost dashboard tagged with `source: slack`.

**Effort:** 8–10 hours.

---

### Task M3-D3 — `teams-bridge` service + Teams OAuth + `/lq` flows

**Status:** Plumbing (Teams bridge service + OAuth install + identity mapping) **in M3 scope**. Slash-command surface (`/lq` and `/lq ask` flows) **descoped to M4 / community contribution** alongside the Slack-side M3-D2 per [PRD §9 DE-288](PRD.md#de-288--slackteams-lq-slash-command--quick-skill-flow--deferred-to-m4--community-contribution).

**Scope:**
- Mirror of M3-D1 + M3-D2 for Microsoft Teams:
  - New `teams-bridge/` service (Python, FastAPI). *(plumbing, M3 scope)*
  - Docker Compose `teams` profile. *(plumbing, M3 scope)*
  - Teams bot manifest at `teams-bridge/manifest.json`. *(plumbing, M3 scope)*
  - OAuth install flow using Microsoft Bot Framework auth. *(plumbing, M3 scope)*
  - `/lq` and `/lq ask` flows identical in behavior to Slack. *(descoped to M4 / community contribution per DE-288)*
- Identity-mapping: Teams user's email (from M365) must match an LQ.AI user's email. *(plumbing, M3 scope)*
- Security review per CODEOWNERS.

**Dependencies:** M3-D1 (plumbing). The `/lq` flow parity depends on the Slack-side M3-D2 implementation that lands when DE-288 resolves.

**Output:** Teams bridge service is installable and OAuth-bound at v0.3.0 release; slash-command surface lands with DE-288.

**Verification:**
- Plumbing path: install the bot in a Teams test tenant; complete OAuth; confirm identity mapping surfaces in the LQ.AI admin UI (M3-D4).
- Slash-command verification deferred to DE-288.

**Effort:** ~4 hours for the plumbing-only path (down from the full 8–12-hour estimate that included the slash-command flow); the deferred slash-command surface is sized in DE-288.

---

### Task M3-D4 — Bot configuration in LQ.AI admin UI

**Status:** Admin UI shell (install/uninstall, workspace/tenant name, linked-user count) **in M3 scope**. The "configure quick-ask skill" dropdown UI and the `/lq` invocation audit-log surface remain visible but inert until DE-288's slash-command surface lands — surfacing the dropdown alongside DE-288 keeps the admin UI from churning when the slash command arrives.

**Scope:**
- New SvelteKit admin route `web/src/routes/lq-ai/admin/intake-bridges/`:
  - Slack section: install/uninstall, workspace name, linked-user count, "configure quick-ask skill" dropdown. *(install/uninstall + workspace name + linked-user count: M3 scope; quick-ask-skill dropdown UI visible but disabled with a "deferred to DE-288" tooltip until that DE resolves)*
  - Teams section: install/uninstall, tenant name, linked-user count, "configure quick-ask skill" dropdown. *(same posture as Slack section)*
  - Audit log: recent `/lq` invocations with user / channel / matched-skill / cost. *(UI shell ships empty in M3; populates when DE-288's slash-command flow lands)*
- Backend: `/api/v1/admin/intake-bridges` endpoints for the above.

**Dependencies:** M3-D3 (plumbing).

**Output:** Admins configure Slack/Teams bridge installation, OAuth status, and identity mapping entirely from the LQ.AI admin UI at v0.3.0 release; no env-var edits, no redeploys for plumbing-config changes. The quick-ask configuration surface arrives with DE-288.

**Verification:**
- Plumbing path: admin UI walks through install → confirm OAuth status → confirm linked-user count.
- Quick-ask configuration verification: deferred to DE-288.

**Effort:** ~4–5 hours for the plumbing-only path (down from the full 6–8-hour estimate that assumed the slash-command surface was live).

---

## Phase E — Acceptance + documentation finalization

### Task M3-E1 — Pre-tag fresh-install verification

**Scope:**
- Destroy all volumes and images; fresh clone; full `docker compose up --build` with all M3-relevant profiles (`--profile slack --profile teams`).
- Walk through the M3 surfaces that ship in v0.3.0:
  - Playbook engine: run NDA playbook against sample NDA in web app; run the Easy Playbook wizard against 5 sample NDAs; verify both results.
  - Word Add-In plumbing (M3-B1/B2/B8): generate a manifest from the admin UI; sideload in Word desktop via the unsigned-manifest path (Microsoft 365 Admin Center will warn about the unsigned add-in, which is expected at v0.3.0); confirm the task pane loads, OAuth completes, and the version handshake against the deployment succeeds. *(Feature surface inside the task pane is descoped to M4 per [DE-287](PRD.md#de-287--word-add-in-feature-surface-chat-skills-playbooks-tier-badge--deferred-to-m4--community-contribution); signed manifest + distribution package is descoped to community per [DE-295](PRD.md#de-295--word-add-in-code-signing-certificate--signed-manifest-ci-community-led); manifest-install + auth + version-check path is what verifies in M3.)*
  - Tabular Review: select 5 sample NDAs; run a 4-column tabular extraction; export XLSX; verify in Excel.
  - Slack bridge plumbing (M3-D1): install in a test workspace; complete OAuth; confirm identity binding surfaces in the LQ.AI admin UI (M3-D4). *(Slash-command surface descoped to M4 per [DE-288](PRD.md#de-288--slackteams-lq-slash-command--quick-skill-flow--deferred-to-m4--community-contribution); install + OAuth + identity binding is what verifies in M3.)*
  - Teams bridge plumbing (M3-D3): same posture as Slack — install + OAuth + identity binding.
- Document any blockers found as deferred enhancements **before** tagging.
- Reviewing-attorney walk-through of the Playbook (web) + Tabular surfaces against real-world contracts. *(Word add-in feature-surface review deferred to whichever milestone DE-287 lands in.)*

**Dependencies:** All of Phases A–D in their M3 scope.

**Output:** Fresh-install validation passes for everything that ships in v0.3.0; tagging-ready state confirmed.

**Verification:**
- All M3-scope surfaces (Playbooks web + Easy Playbook, Word add-in plumbing, Tabular Review, Slack/Teams plumbing) work end-to-end on a fresh install.
- Any blockers either fixed or explicitly accepted as DE-XXX entries with severity.
- Reviewing-attorney signoff on the Playbook (web) + Tabular surfaces.

**Effort:** 6–8 hours.

---

### Task M3-E2 — Documentation finalization

**Scope:**
- New documents:
  - `docs/playbooks.md` — full Playbook engine documentation: schema, executor architecture, built-in playbooks, Easy Playbook wizard, authoring conventions, integration with Citation Engine.
  - `docs/word-addin.md` — Word Add-In documentation: architecture, installation (deployment-side + M365 Admin Center side), supported flows, manifest signing posture, threat model.
  - `docs/tabular-review.md` — Tabular Review documentation: skill `output_format: table` mode, LangGraph workflow, UI surface, export formats.
  - `docs/intake-bridges.md` — Slack and Teams bridge documentation: install flow, slash-command flows, configuration, security posture.
- Learn-tab playgrounds (per the M2 documentation convention — built with the `playground` skill, self-contained single-file explorers that render in `/lq-ai/learn`):
  - **Playbook execution cascade** — walks an operator through how a playbook executes step-by-step against a sample contract: position-by-position extraction, classification, citation generation, and assembly into the final review. Uses one of the synthetic NDAs as the source document so the playground works offline.
  - **Tabular Review interactive grid** — small N × M grid against a sample document set (e.g., 3 NDAs × 3 columns). Each cell click opens the citation modal so operators see the cell → citation flow. Pairs with the new `contract-snapshot` / `nda-snapshot` / `msa-snapshot` reference skills.
  - **Word Add-In install + flow walkthrough** *(optional, "anything else from M3 worth visualizing")* — guided diagram of the unsigned-manifest sideload path, the OAuth flow between Word and the deployment, and the M3-B8 version-handshake interaction. Helpful because the Word add-in is the M3 surface most operators have not seen before (the chat surface, Knowledge, and Skills are M1 carryovers).
- Updated documents:
  - `docs/PRD.md` — changelog entry for M3 release; §3.7 (Playbooks) and §3.14 (Tabular Review) statuses flipped from "Deferred-M3" to "SHIPPED"; §3.9 (Word Add-In) status flipped to "Plumbing shipped in M3 (unsigned-manifest path) — feature surface deferred to M4 (see DE-287); signed distribution community-led (see DE-295)"; §3.15 (Slack/Teams Bridge) status flipped to "Plumbing shipped in M3 — slash-command surface deferred to M4 (see DE-288)."
  - `docs/architecture.md` — Mermaid diagram updated with LangGraph runtime, Word add-in, tabular workflow, slack-bridge, teams-bridge components.
  - `docs/quickstart.md` — new sections for Playbook execution, Word add-in install, Tabular review, Slack/Teams bridges. **Explicit developer onboarding pass:** the document must include a clean "I just cloned the repo — how do I pull dependencies, bring the stack up, log in, and verify the M3 surfaces are working?" path that a mid-level engineer can follow end-to-end without reading source. Includes the synthetic-corpus paths in `docs/quickstart/sample-ndas/` and `docs/quickstart/sample-msas/` as the worked examples for Playbook + Tabular Review.
  - `README.md` — capability list updated to reflect M3 surfaces as shipped; "Getting started" section explicit about `git clone`, dependency install, `docker compose up`, first-login flow, and how to attach the synthetic corpus. The fresh-install verification path from M3-E1 doubles as the README's recommended walkthrough.
  - `docs/compliance/soc2-alignment.md` — controls updated for the new external trust boundaries (Word add-in OAuth, Slack/Teams bridges).
  - `docs/compliance/iso27001-alignment.md` — same.
  - `docs/procurement/sig-lite.md` — questions about Playbooks, Word add-in distribution, and Slack/Teams data-handling updated.
- API documentation audit (covers OpenAPI sketches + db-schema + cross-references):
  - `docs/api/backend-openapi.yaml` — every M3 endpoint (playbook CRUD + execute + executions; tabular preview-cost + execute + executions; word-addin OAuth + version + manifest-generate; slack-bridge + teams-bridge install + OAuth; any new admin-UI endpoints from M3-D4) reflects the shipped shape. Schema-conformance tests for each endpoint pass.
  - `docs/db-schema.md` — every M3 migration's tables, columns, indexes, and constraints documented; foreign-key relationships diagrammed.
  - PRD cross-references: every M3 task that landed should have a paragraph in the appropriate PRD §3 capability section linking back to the implementation; `grep -nE "M3-[A-Z][0-9]" docs/PRD.md` should return non-empty for every shipped M3 task.
- New DE entries in `docs/PRD.md` §9:
  - DE-XXX (M3-1 alternative): separate `executor/` service for the LangGraph runtime.
  - DE-XXX: any other ideas surfaced during M3 build.
- File the §8 deferred-to-M4 carryovers (per M3-kickoff scope decision):
  - Per-skill prompt-injection detection rates — M4.
  - OpenSSF Silver Best Practices Badge — M4.
  - Mutation testing per release — M4.

**Dependencies:** M3-E1.

**Output:** Documentation matches implementation; a fresh developer cloning the repo can stand up the stack and walk all M3 surfaces using only the README, quickstart, and the three Learn-tab playgrounds; the API surface is fully documented and conformance-tested.

**Verification:**
- Reviewing-attorney walk-through against the quickstart passes.
- Cross-reference audit: `grep -rn` of internal links resolves cleanly.
- PRD changelog entry committed.
- **Developer onboarding check:** a non-maintainer engineer follows the README's Getting Started + the docs/quickstart.md walkthrough and can: (a) bring the stack up via `docker compose`, (b) log in as the bootstrap admin, (c) attach the synthetic NDA + MSA corpora, (d) run a Playbook against one NDA, (e) run a Tabular Review across 5 NDAs, (f) install the Word add-in via the unsigned-manifest path. No questions to the maintainer team during the walkthrough.
- All three Learn-tab playgrounds render correctly on a fresh build (svelte-check passes; visual smoke against `/lq-ai/learn` confirms each is reachable from the index).
- API doc audit grep: `grep -rn "M3-[A-Z][0-9]" docs/PRD.md` returns at least one match per shipped M3 task.

**Effort:** 14–18 hours (raised from 10–14 to reflect the explicit playground + onboarding + API-audit scope).

## Phase F — Observability deepening (post-acceptance)

Added 2026-05-22 per the OpenTelemetry Deepening mini-PRD at [`docs/proposals/opentelemetry-deepening.md`](proposals/opentelemetry-deepening.md). Phase F lands the operator-facing observability story that the M1 OTel SDK shipped but did not complete: end-to-end trace correlation across the api → gateway → provider chain, manual domain spans on the four high-value LQ.AI operations (Citation Engine cascade, Anonymization middleware, Skill runner, Playbook + Tabular workflows) with explicit anonymization-of-attributes guarantees, and deployment recipes plus a `docs/observability.md` operator guide.

Phase F runs **after** M3-E1 + M3-E2 — fresh-install verification (E1) gets the observability stack as a test target, and the docs finalization (E2) absorbs the new `docs/observability.md` cross-references. The three F tasks correspond 1:1 to the three PRs in the mini-PRD.

### Task M3-F1 — Trace context propagation audit + regression test

**Scope:** Verify W3C `traceparent` / `tracestate` propagation across the api → gateway → provider chain, fix any gaps the audit surfaces, and pin the behavior with regression tests in both `api/tests/test_trace_propagation.py` and `gateway/tests/test_trace_propagation.py`. Update [`docs/architecture.md`](architecture.md) §OBS to confirm end-to-end correlation.

**Dependencies:** None (the existing M1 OTel SDK + httpx-auto-instrumentation are the substrate).

**Verification:** Per the [mini-PRD's PR 1 acceptance criteria](proposals/opentelemetry-deepening.md#pr-1-acceptance) — regression test exists in both services, asserts a chat-send produces a single trace ID across api + gateway, and would fail without any fix applied.

**Effort:** ~6–8 hours.

### Task M3-F2 — Domain spans + rich attributes on the four high-value operations

**Scope:** Manual instrumentation of Citation Engine cascade (`api/app/citation/verification.py`), Anonymization middleware (`gateway/app/anonymization/middleware.py`), Skill runner, Inference dispatch (`gateway/app/router.py`), and Playbook + Tabular executors. Each gets a top-level span with documented attributes, child spans per sub-operation, and span events for notable transitions. Anonymization-of-attributes guarantee enforced via test: span attributes carry counts and types, never raw entity values.

**Dependencies:** M3-F1 (so the spans land on already-correlated traces). M3-C2 + M3-C3 (so the tabular executor exists to instrument); both have shipped.

**Verification:** Per the [mini-PRD's PR 2 acceptance criteria](proposals/opentelemetry-deepening.md#pr-2-acceptance) — each documented span + attribute is emitted under expected code paths (in-memory OTel exporter tests); `gateway/tests/test_anonymization_observability.py` asserts no raw entity values appear in span attributes; no measurable p99 chat-send regression.

**Effort:** ~14–18 hours.

### Task M3-F3 — Deployment recipes + `docs/observability.md` + OTel-evaluation Learn-tab playground

**Scope:** New `deploy/observability/` subtree with two recipes (Grafana Tempo + Loki + Prometheus stack, and standalone Collector for operators with existing backends). New `docs/observability.md` operator guide covering the env-var matrix, per-signal inventory, anonymization-and-telemetry posture, the no-telemetry-by-default promise, and what's not yet shipped (links to DE-299 through DE-303). Starter Grafana dashboard with three panels (tier mix, p99 by route, error rate).

**OTel-evaluation Learn-tab playground:** A new Learn-tab playground (built with the `playground` skill, sitting alongside the Playbook + Tabular Review playgrounds added in M3-E2) that explains how to *use* the OTel signals for operator evaluations. Walks through:
- The trace tree for a representative chat-send (api request → gateway dispatch → provider call → citation cascade child spans → anonymization child spans), with annotations explaining what each span's attributes tell the operator.
- The five operator questions the trace + metric inventory answers: (1) "why was this chat slow?" (2) "how much did this cost?" (3) "did anonymization run on this request?" (4) "which provider+model did each tier route to?" (5) "what is the citation-cascade outcome distribution across my traffic?"
- Sample TraceQL / LogQL / Prometheus PromQL queries that pull each answer from the appropriate signal.
- The anonymization-of-attributes guarantee: a side-by-side showing the attributes that DO appear in spans (entity counts, types, tiers) vs the attributes that do NOT (raw PERSON names, MATTER_NUMBERs).

The playground is the bridge between the implementation work in M3-F1 + M3-F2 and the operator's day-2 reality: "I have OTel; how do I get value from it?" It pairs with `docs/observability.md` as the visual / interactive companion to the prose operator guide.

**Dependencies:** M3-F2 (the recipe README walks operators through verifying domain spans land in Tempo, so the spans need to exist; the playground's annotated trace tree references the spans M3-F2 emits).

**Verification:** Per the [mini-PRD's PR 3 acceptance criteria](proposals/opentelemetry-deepening.md#pr-3-acceptance) — `docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f deploy/observability/grafana-tempo-loki/docker-compose.observability.yml config` produces a valid merged config; a non-maintainer following the recipe README sees a chat-send trace in Tempo within 15 minutes; `docs/observability.md` is linked from README.md Quickstart and HONEST-STATE.md §6+§7; "no telemetry by default" regression pinned by a test in `api/tests/test_observability.py`. **Playground verification:** the OTel-evaluation playground renders at `/lq-ai/learn`, walks through the five operator questions with sample queries, and the annotated trace tree references the actual span / attribute names emitted by M3-F2 (no drift between docs and code).

**Effort:** ~16–22 hours (raised from 12–16 to reflect the OTel-evaluation playground scope).

### Phase F deferred surfaces

Seven OTel-adjacent surfaces are filed as DEs rather than absorbed into Phase F (per the mini-PRD's framing — any one can be claimed independently by a community contributor):

- [DE-299](PRD.md#de-299--otel-instrumentation-for-sqlalchemy--arq-workers-otel-deepening-de-a) — SQLAlchemy + ARQ worker instrumentation
- [DE-300](PRD.md#de-300--log-trace-correlation-via-structured-logger-trace_id--span_id-injection-otel-deepening-de-b) — Log-trace correlation
- [DE-301](PRD.md#de-301--otel-meterprovider-for-metrics-export-otel-deepening-de-c) — OTel MeterProvider for metrics export
- [DE-302](PRD.md#de-302--reconcile-otel-with-the-openwebui-fork-s-inherited-telemetry-otel-deepening-de-d) — Reconcile with the OpenWebUI fork's inherited OTel
- [DE-303](PRD.md#de-303--browser-rum-via-opentelemetry-sdk-trace-web-otel-deepening-de-e) — Browser RUM (opt-in, CSP-reviewed)
- PRD §9 — Published SLO catalog (already on the deferred list; builds on the M3-F2 span inventory)
- PRD §9 — Performance regression tracking (already on the deferred list; builds on the M3-F2 span inventory)

---

## Total effort estimate

The original M3 estimate was ~227–302 hours across 27 tasks. Two rounds of scope-reduction land at v0.3.0:

* **2026-05-21 (M3-A6 PR #57 close)** — descopes M3-B3/B4/B5/B6 (Word feature surface, ~34–44 hr; see [DE-287](PRD.md#de-287--word-add-in-feature-surface-chat-skills-playbooks-tier-badge--deferred-to-m4--community-contribution)) and M3-D2 + the slash-command facet of M3-D3 (Slack/Teams `/lq` surface, ~12–14 hr; see [DE-288](PRD.md#de-288--slackteams-lq-slash-command--quick-skill-flow--deferred-to-m4--community-contribution)); rescopes M3-D4 to plumbing-only (~4–5 hr instead of 6–8).
* **2026-05-21 (M3 Phase B PR #59 open)** — descopes M3-B7 (signed manifest + enterprise distribution package, ~12–16 hr) to a community-led effort per [DE-295](PRD.md#de-295--word-add-in-code-signing-certificate--signed-manifest-ci-community-led). v0.3.0 ships the unsigned-manifest sideload path; the signing CI lands as a community PR when the cert procurement completes.

| Phase | Tasks (M3 scope) | Effort |
|---|---|---|
| **0 — Pre-M3 hardening** | 3 (all shipped) | ~13–18 hours |
| **A — Playbook engine** | 6 (all shipped through M3-A6) | ~62–82 hours |
| **B — Word Add-In** | 3 plumbing in M3 (B1 + B2 + B8); 4 descoped to M4 (B3/B4/B5/B6 → DE-287); 1 descoped to community (B7 → DE-295) | ~22–28 hours |
| **C — Tabular / Multi-Document Review** | 4 | ~36–48 hours |
| **D — Slack / Teams Light Intake Bridge** | 3 plumbing (D1 + D3 plumbing-only + D4 plumbing-only); 1 descoped (D2 → DE-288); D3's slash-command facet also descoped | ~12–20 hours |
| **E — Acceptance + docs (3 playgrounds + onboarding + API audit)** | 2 | ~20–26 hours |
| **F — Observability deepening (incl. OTel-eval playground)** | 3 | ~36–48 hours |
| **Total (M3 scope)** | **~19 active + 7 descoped** | **~201–276 hours** |

The revised range fits comfortably in a **~6-week M3 build** by a single contributor working full-time, or ~10 weeks part-time. The largest remaining tracks are Phase C (Tabular Review) and Phase F (Observability deepening, added 2026-05-22). M3-E2 + M3-F3 together carry the three Learn-tab playgrounds (Playbook execution cascade; Tabular Review interactive grid; OTel-evaluation walkthrough), the developer onboarding pass on README + quickstart, and the API documentation audit. Phase B's M3 work is the smallest active track at ~22–28 hr; M3-B7 + its procurement timeline runs alongside on the community side.

## How to use this with Claude Code

The recommended workflow mirrors the M1 and M2 implementations:

1. **Hand Claude Code this document, plus `docs/PRD.md`, `docs/db-schema.md`, `docs/api/backend-openapi.yaml`, `docs/api/gateway-openapi.yaml`, `gateway.yaml.example`, and `CLAUDE.md`.**
2. **Pick the next task by ID:** "Implement Task M3-0.1 — DE-283 fresh-install login UX."
3. **Let Claude Code execute the full task in one session.** Each task is sized for a focused session.
4. **Verify against the documented verification step.** If verification fails, work with Claude Code to fix; do not move to the next task until current verifies.
5. **Move to the next task.** Tasks marked **[parallel]** can run concurrently in separate sessions if parallel agent execution is available.
6. **Don't let Claude Code make architectural decisions mid-task.** Decisions M3-1 through M3-5 are locked at the start; if a task surfaces a question those decisions don't anticipate, stop, decide, document.
7. **Surface ideas as DE-XXX entries.** When Claude Code surfaces useful ideas out of M3 scope, file them as deferred enhancements in PRD §9.
8. **Practicing-attorney attestation is required** for tasks that introduce or modify legal substance — built-in playbooks (M3-A3, M3-A5), the Easy Playbook wizard outputs (M3-A6), and the reviewing-attorney walk-throughs in M3-E1.

---

## Risks and mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| M3 is genuinely 4 tracks in 8 weeks; scope creep would push v0.3 to v0.4 timing. | Decision B at M3-kickoff committed to "all four tracks must-ship." If mid-M3 a track is clearly slipping, surface as a scope-reframe decision to Kevin **before** tagging — not at release time. Build in a mid-M3 checkpoint (end of Phase B) for honest re-assessment. |
| Code-signing certificate acquisition has multi-week lead time. | **Revised at PR #59 (2026-05-21):** M3-B7 descoped to community-led effort per [DE-295](PRD.md#de-295--word-add-in-code-signing-certificate--signed-manifest-ci-community-led); the v0.3.0 release ships the unsigned-manifest sideload path with explicit "this signed at v0.3.x once the community procurement closes" framing in the release notes. SignPath open-source sponsorship is the recommended first path; community-funded DigiCert EV / Sectigo OV are alternatives. Maintainer release velocity is no longer coupled to the procurement clock. |
| LangGraph version churn breaks the Playbook executor between releases. | Pin LangGraph version in `api/pyproject.toml`. Bug-fix LangGraph upgrades land as patch releases with regression tests. |
| Word add-in development on a non-Windows primary dev machine (macOS-only contributor) limits coverage of Word desktop on Windows. | Office.js is cross-platform but Word Desktop on Windows is the dominant enterprise client. Test matrix in CI includes Word Desktop (macOS), Word Online, Word for iPad. Word Desktop (Windows) tested manually before tagging, with an explicit DE filed if a Windows-only issue is discovered. |
| Easy Playbook wizard produces low-quality drafts on small / inconsistent corpora. | Reviewing-attorney quality review on a curated 5-corpus before M3-A6 closes. UI explicitly frames the output as "starting-point draft — review before use." Document expected corpus characteristics (≥5 documents, same contract type). |
| Slack/Teams bridges introduce new external trust boundaries with new vulnerability classes. | Security review per CODEOWNERS on each bridge task (M3-D1, M3-D3). Bridges run as optional Docker Compose profiles; off by default. Audit log of every `/lq` invocation. |
| Tabular executions for large document sets (200 docs × 10 columns = 2,000 cells) could blow cost budgets. | Cost preview before execution **with confirm step** (M3-C2). Operators see the estimate before kickoff. Per-column ensemble verification is opt-in, not default. |
| Citation Engine load on the Playbook executor (every position-classification cites chunks; every citation runs the 4-stage cascade) could slow playbook execution beyond the 3-min budget. | Phase A integration tests measure P95 latency on a 50-page MSA against the budget. Ensemble verification is opt-in, not default, for playbook executions. If budget exceeded, single-judge fallback is acceptable for the position-classification surface (a position-level citation is lower-stakes than a chat-level citation). |

## What this plan does not cover

A few items deliberately out of scope for M3; tracked for M4 or later:

### Deferred to M4 (per M3-kickoff decision on §8 carryovers)

- **Per-skill prompt-injection detection rates** — PRD §1.9 commitment; deferred to M4. Tracked at PRD §9.
- **OpenSSF Silver Best Practices Badge** — was targeted at M2 release per PRD §1.8; deferred to M4. Tracked at PRD §9.
- **Mutation testing per release** — PRD §1.9 commitment; deferred to M4. Tracked at PRD §9.

### Existing M4 scope items

- **Autonomous Layer** — per [PRD §8 M4](PRD.md#m4--autonomous-layer-and-contract-repository-8-weeks-after-m3).
- **Contract Repository auto-relationship detection** — per [PRD §3.16](PRD.md#316-contract-repository--auto-relationship-detection-m4).
- **DE-279 — Case citation validation (Bluebook resolution)** — likely M4, citation-type-2 surface separate from M2's KB-quote engine.
- **DE-280 — Case-content accuracy (statement vs. judicial opinion)** — likely M4, hardest of the three citation surfaces.
- **DE-282 — Anonymization Layer empirical validation on legal document corpus** — community-friendly DE; M4 or community-led.

### Deferred forward-looking items

- **AppSource public listing of the Word Add-In** — enterprise sideload ships in M3-B7; the public AppSource listing is a M3.x or later follow-on (less procurement-critical than enterprise sideload).
- **Google Docs Add-On** — DE-083 in PRD §9; sister to Word Add-In, deferred.
