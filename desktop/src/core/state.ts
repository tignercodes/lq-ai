 * Derive the launcher state from a real engine probe + `docker compose ps` snapshot.

 *   1. engine not usable        -> NO_ENGINE
 *   2. any service failed       -> FAILED   (exited / unhealthy)
 *   3. no services at all       -> STOPPED
 *   4. all 9 services healthy   -> HEALTHY
 *   5. otherwise (coming up)    -> STACK_STARTING
 * The "pulling images" and "models downloading" windows are surfaced separately by the
 * orchestrator from command/log signals; they are not decidable from `ps` alone.
