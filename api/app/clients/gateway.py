"""HTTP client for the LQ.AI Inference Gateway.

A4 landed the skeleton with ``health_check()`` only; B5 fleshes out the
full chat-completion surface. The client owns a long-lived
``httpx.AsyncClient`` pooled across calls (per CLAUDE.md "reuse the same
client across calls"; do not construct a fresh client per request).

Per ADR 0002 / ``.env.example``: every backend → gateway request includes
``X-LQ-AI-Gateway-Key``, the shared secret. The gateway rejects requests
that lack it. The default-headers approach below stamps the key on every
call.

Error translation
-----------------

Gateway errors (parsed from the ``GatewayError`` envelope) and transport
errors (timeout, network failure, malformed body) are translated to the
backend's ``LQAIError`` hierarchy (per :doc:`docs/adr/0003-error-handling.md`):

* Timeout → :class:`app.errors.GatewayTimeout` (HTTP 504).
* Network / DNS / TLS failure → :class:`app.errors.GatewayUnreachable`
  (HTTP 503).
* Gateway 5xx → :class:`app.errors.GatewayUnreachable` (HTTP 503; the
  operator sees "service unavailable" rather than the underlying detail
  per the brief).
* Gateway 401 (bad gateway key) → logged loudly and re-raised as
  :class:`app.errors.GatewayUnreachable` (the user must not see "the
  operator misconfigured the gateway key" — they see "service unavailable").
* Gateway 4xx with a parseable body → mapped via
  :func:`app.errors.map_gateway_error_code` to the right backend
  exception class (``provider_unavailable``, ``invalid_model``, etc.).
* Body that fails to parse → :class:`app.errors.GatewayInvalidResponse`
  (HTTP 502) — indicates contract drift.

Streaming
---------

``chat_completion_stream`` returns an :class:`AsyncIterator` of
:class:`ChatCompletionChunk` objects. The gateway emits OpenAI-format SSE
frames (``data: <json>\\n\\n``) terminated by ``data: [DONE]\\n\\n``;
the iterator parses each frame, decodes the JSON envelope, and yields
the parsed chunk. Mid-stream gateway errors come through as a final
SSE frame with ``{"error": {...}}`` — the iterator translates that to
the appropriate :class:`LQAIError` subclass and raises (so the caller
sees one stream and then an exception, not a mixed signal).

Embeddings
----------

The gateway's ``/v1/embeddings`` endpoint is 501 until B6 (OpenAI adapter
ships embeddings). The :meth:`GatewayClient.embeddings` method exists so
its callers (the future KB / RAG path) compile against a stable
signature; today it propagates the gateway's 501 directly.
