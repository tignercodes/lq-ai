"""FastAPI dependencies for authenticated endpoints.

`get_current_user` is the canonical dependency for any handler that needs
"the calling user." It:

1. Pulls the bearer token from the `Authorization` header.
2. Decodes and validates the JWT (signature + expiry + type).
3. Looks up the user in the DB.
4. Raises 401 with a `WWW-Authenticate: Bearer` header for any of the above
   failing — matching the OpenAPI sketch's documented 401 contract and
   RFC 6750's bearer-token error response shape.

A separate `require_admin` would build on this; that lives wherever it is
first needed (admin endpoints land later — see C7, D3, D4, D5, D6, D7).
