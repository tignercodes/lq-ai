"""Chats and messages endpoints — Task C3 (Chat service + persistence).

Surface (per ``docs/api/backend-openapi.yaml``):

* ``POST   /api/v1/chats``                                — create.
* ``GET    /api/v1/chats``                                — list with cursor
  pagination and ``project_id`` / ``archived`` filters.
* ``GET    /api/v1/chats/{chat_id}``                      — fetch single.
* ``PATCH  /api/v1/chats/{chat_id}``                      — partial update
  (title, archived).
* ``DELETE /api/v1/chats/{chat_id}``                      — soft-delete.
* ``GET    /api/v1/chats/{chat_id}/messages``             — list messages
  with cursor pagination.
* ``POST   /api/v1/chats/{chat_id}/messages``             — **the keystone**:
  persist user message → forward to gateway → persist assistant message
  (or stream SSE chunks and persist the assistant row at end-of-stream).

All endpoints inherit the auth + must-change-password gate from the
chats router's router-level ``Depends(get_active_user)`` in
``app.api.__init__`` (B2 pattern). Each handler also takes
``ActiveUser`` directly so the user object is available for owner
checks (FastAPI dedupes the dependency).

**Per-user isolation.** Chats are scoped to ``owner_id``. Cross-user
access returns 404, not 403, to avoid leaking existence (same posture
as C4 / files and C7 / projects).

**The keystone POST /messages flow** (the heart of C3):

1. Validate auth + chat ownership (404 on cross-user).
2. Persist a ``user`` message row (with the request's ``skills`` list
   captured as ``applied_skills``).
3. Auto-rename the chat from the first user message if its title is
   still ``"New chat"``.
4. Generate a UUID for the eventual assistant message.
5. Forward to the gateway via :class:`GatewayClient`. Pass
   ``lq_ai_chat_id`` and ``lq_ai_message_id`` so the gateway's routing
   log row carries the same identifiers (closing the A2-deferred FKs).
6. Streaming: emit OpenAI-style SSE chunks per ADR 0007. Persist the
   assistant row at end-of-stream — partial writes during streaming
   would expose half-built rows to readers. If the stream fails
   mid-way, persist a row with whatever content was received and the
   error code populated (full audit; clients can resume).
7. Non-streaming: persist the assistant row from the gateway's
   complete response.

We do NOT write ``inference_routing_log`` from the backend — the
gateway is the canonical writer (B4). The backend persists the message
row; the gateway writes the routing log with ``message_id`` pointing at
that same row.

    verdict (``verified``, ``verification_method``,

    render the five citation states distinctly — including the
    paraphrase-judge "partial" verdict surfaced via the ``partial``

    The legacy JSONB column is kept at its ``'[]'`` default by the
    chat-send path; readers should consume this endpoint, not the
    column. The column itself remains for backward compatibility with
    older clients and is slated for retirement by M2-C2.

    Wave D.1 T4. Admin-only re-run of a refused user message: the
    backend forwards the original user prompt to the gateway with both
    ``minimum_inference_tier`` and ``lq_ai_project_minimum_inference_tier``
    set to ``None`` so no tier floor binds for this turn. The new
    assistant row is persisted with ``kind='ai'`` on initial INSERT
    (via the ``kind`` parameter on :func:`_persist_assistant_message`)
    so the UI can tell it apart from the refusal it supersedes, and so
    the row's kind never disagrees with the audit row written by the
    caller.

    Mirrors the synchronous, non-streaming branch of ``send_message``
    (no SSE; one-shot JSON) — the override surface is admin-driven and
    doesn't require streaming. Returns the persisted assistant
    :class:`Message` plus the gateway-written
    ``inference_routing_log`` row id (lookup by ``message_id``; the
