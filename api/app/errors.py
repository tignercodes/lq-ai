"""Backend exception hierarchy — the api/ side of `lq_ai.errors`.

Per :doc:`docs/adr/0003-error-handling.md` (Option B), each subsystem owns
its own typed exception hierarchy. The cross-subsystem contract is the
error-code enum in the OpenAPI sketches; this module names the codes the
backend emits, and the FastAPI exception handler in :mod:`app.main`
translates them to the wire shape documented in
``docs/api/backend-openapi.yaml`` as the ``Error`` schema:

.. code-block:: json

    {
      "detail": {
        "code": "<stable code>",
        "message": "<human-readable explanation>",
        "details": { ... }
      }
    }

Why this shape rather than ``{"error": {...}}`` (the gateway's choice):

* Matches FastAPI's native ``HTTPException`` response shape, so tooling
  that already understands FastAPI errors works without translation.
* Matches the existing B2 forced-password-change pattern.
* Matches what the OpenWebUI fork's auth-delegation glue already reads.

The two wrappers (backend ``detail`` vs. gateway ``error``) are
deliberately different; the inner ``code`` / ``message`` / ``details``
shape is the binding contract and is identical on both sides. See ADR
0003 for the rationale.

Usage::

    from app.errors import GatewayUnreachable

    raise GatewayUnreachable(
        message="Inference Gateway did not respond within timeout",
        details={"timeout_seconds": 30.0},
    )

The handler in :mod:`app.main` catches every :class:`LQAIError`,
serializes the canonical envelope, and returns the right HTTP status.
