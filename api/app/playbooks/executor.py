"""Playbook executor — builds the LangGraph workflow and runs it.

Public surface: :func:`run_playbook_execution`. The endpoint layer
(``app.api.playbooks``) calls it from a FastAPI ``BackgroundTask`` so
the kick-off endpoint can return immediately with a 202 while the
workflow runs out-of-band.

Graph shape
-----------

retrieve → classify → redline → compile → END

All nodes are sequential; conditional branching isn't required for
the M3-A2 skeleton. The LangGraph runtime is still the right
substrate because:

* M3-C2 (Tabular Review) reuses the same runtime with a different
  graph shape (per-document x per-column instead of per-position).
* The node-level decomposition keeps each step testable in isolation.
* A future per-node checkpointing pass (resume on worker restart)
  drops in without restructuring the workflow.

The executor catches exceptions at the graph-invocation boundary and
writes ``status='error'`` to the row so the kick-off endpoint's
caller always sees a terminal state on poll.
