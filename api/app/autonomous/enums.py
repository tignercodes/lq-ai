"""Autonomous executor enums and phase-grant map — M4-A2.

``Phase`` and ``HaltState`` are imported from the canonical source of
truth in :mod:`app.schemas.autonomous` — do NOT redefine them here.

This module adds:

* :class:`ToolIntent` — the closed set of tool operations the executor
  can request. The chokepoint (:func:`~app.autonomous.nodes.guarded_tool_call`,
  implemented in M4-A3) validates every tool call against the grant set
  for the session's current phase.

* :data:`PHASE_GRANTS` — the authoritative per-phase grant set. A node
  may only invoke a tool intent that appears in this map for the phase
  it is currently in. The map is immutable at runtime (frozensets as
  values).
