"""KB-arrival watch trigger — M4-B4.

When a file is attached to a watched knowledge base
(:func:`app.api.knowledge_bases.attach_file`), this module spawns one
autonomous session per enabled :class:`~app.models.autonomous.AutonomousWatch`
on that KB. The "doc arrives in a watched KB" event is the **attach**, not
ingest: :func:`attach_file` requires ``ingestion_status=='ready'`` (set only
at the end of ``ingest_file``), so at ingest time the file is in zero KBs and
a hook there would never fire.

The core logic lives in :func:`fire_watches_for_kb` with an injectable
``enqueue`` parameter (default the real
:func:`~app.workers.queue.enqueue_autonomous_session_job`), mirroring the
B3 schedule sweep (:func:`app.workers.autonomous_worker._run_schedule_sweep`)
so tests can drive it directly via the conftest SAVEPOINT session with a
stub enqueue.

The session is owned by ``watch.user_id`` — NOT the user who attached the
file. In practice the KB owner is the attacher (a watch can only target a KB
its creator owns), but ownership is taken from the watch unconditionally so
the autonomous layer's hard per-user isolation holds regardless of trigger
path.

    Called by :func:`app.api.knowledge_bases.attach_file` (best-effort,
    after the attach is committed) and directly by tests (with the
    conftest SAVEPOINT session and a stub ``enqueue``).

    For each :class:`~app.models.autonomous.AutonomousWatch` with
    ``knowledge_base_id == kb_id AND enabled AND deleted_at IS NULL``
    (the scan served by ``idx_autonomous_watches_kb_enabled``), it:

    1. Creates an :class:`~app.models.autonomous.AutonomousSession` owned
       by ``watch.user_id`` with ``trigger_kind='watch'``, ``trigger_ref``
       = the watch id, ``status='running'``, ``current_phase='intake'``,
       and ``params`` carrying the non-null subset of ``{"kb_id",
       "playbook_id", "skill_ref", "file_id", "emit_artifacts"}``
       (``emit_artifacts`` is set — to ``True`` — only when the watch
       opted in; Donna ask #8).
    2. Commits once after all session rows are created.
    3. ``await enqueue(session.id)`` for each created session — best-effort;
       the helper swallows transport errors and returns bool, and the loop
       is additionally wrapped so one bad enqueue does not stop the others.
       An orphaned ``running`` session whose enqueue failed is reaped by the
       idle watchdog (consistent with B3).

    Returns the count of sessions spawned.
