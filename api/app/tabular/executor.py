"""Tabular Review executor — builds the LangGraph workflow and runs it.

Public surface: :func:`run_tabular_execution`. The ARQ worker
(``app.workers.tabular_worker.tabular_execution_job``) calls it after
pulling a ``tabular_executions`` row by id.

Graph shape
-----------

load_documents → extract_cells → aggregate → END

All nodes are sequential; per-cell parallelism is a v0.3.x follow-on
if the 200 x 10 latency case forces it (Decision C-3 + risk row 1).
The LangGraph runtime is the right substrate because:

* It already runs in-process inside the existing arq-worker container.
* The same shape pattern as the M3-A2 Playbook executor keeps the two
  workflows mentally cheap to maintain.
* A future per-node checkpointing pass drops in without restructuring.

The executor catches exceptions at the graph-invocation boundary and
writes ``status='failed'`` to the row so the kick-off endpoint's
caller always sees a terminal state on poll.
