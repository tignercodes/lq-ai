"""arq queue helpers — enqueue document-ingest jobs from the API process.

Per ADR 0006 §5: the API's upload handler enqueues an ingest job
after the file row is committed. This module is the API-side helper
for that path. The worker process consumes the queue (see
:mod:`app.workers.document_pipeline`).

Design notes
------------

* The arq queue connection is built from the same ``REDIS_URL`` the
  rest of the API uses (via ``get_settings()``). It's cached as a
  module-global so the API process pools the connection across
  requests rather than reconnecting per upload.
* Enqueue failures are non-fatal for the upload: the upload handler
  catches and logs at WARNING. A row stuck at ``pending`` will be
  swept up by the worker's startup re-enqueue (see
  :mod:`app.workers.document_pipeline`).
* The job name (``ingest_file_job``) is the function the worker
  invokes; the function lives on the worker side. We enqueue by
  string name to avoid pulling worker-only deps into the API
  process.
