"""Shared playbook ``arq`` worker — background jobs for Easy Playbook
generation (M3-A6) and Tabular Review execution (M3-C2).

Sister worker to :mod:`app.workers.document_pipeline` (the ``ingest-worker``
container). Both processes share the same Redis instance for coordination
but consume from **disjoint queues** so a backlog of one workload does not
delay the other.

Why a separate queue
--------------------

Long-running jobs — both Easy Playbook generation (PRD §3.7 NFR up to
10 minutes for a 10-document corpus) and Tabular Review execution (up
to 200 docs x 10 cols = 2000 cells over hours per Phase C prep doc
Decision C-3) — landing on the default ``arq:queue`` would compete
with document-ingest jobs and either side could starve the other
depending on queue depth. Worse, each worker would receive jobs whose
function name it does not register and reject them.

The worker therefore declares ``queue_name = M3_PLAYBOOK_QUEUE_NAME``
and the API-side enqueue helpers build their pool with
``default_queue_name=M3_PLAYBOOK_QUEUE_NAME`` so the playbook +
tabular pipelines never mix with the ingest pipeline.

Why share the queue between Easy Playbook + Tabular
---------------------------------------------------

Per Decision C-3: two arq containers per deployment would double the
operational surface for no isolation win — both workloads are bursty
in different shapes (Easy Playbook = 1-10 docs over ~10 min; Tabular =
up to 2000 cells over hours), but neither saturates a worker long
enough to deserve isolation. If we see queue contention in production,
splitting is a follow-on PR; the queue string stays ``arq:m3a6`` for
on-the-wire compatibility (rename is constant-name-only).

Registered functions:

* ``noop_job`` — lightweight "is the worker consuming?" health probe.
* :func:`app.workers.easy_playbook_worker.easy_playbook_generation_job`
  (M3-A6) — Easy Playbook generation pipeline.
* :func:`app.workers.tabular_worker.tabular_execution_job`
  (M3-C2) — Tabular Review execution pipeline.
* :func:`app.workers.autonomous_worker.autonomous_session_job`
  (M4-A2) — Autonomous Session execution pipeline.

Registered cron jobs:

* :func:`app.workers.autonomous_worker.autonomous_idle_watchdog`
  (M4-A4-ii) — Idle-halt watchdog; runs at the top of every minute
  (``second=0``). Reaps sessions that have gone idle via a two-tick
  ``running → paused → halted`` lifecycle.
* :func:`app.workers.autonomous_worker.autonomous_schedule_dispatcher`
  (M4-B3) — Schedule dispatcher; runs at the top of every minute
  (``second=0``). Spawns one session per due schedule
  (``enabled AND deleted_at IS NULL AND next_run_at <= now()``) and
  advances ``next_run_at`` from the schedule's ``cron_expr``.

Discovered by the ``arq`` CLI via::

    arq app.workers.arq_setup.WorkerSettings
