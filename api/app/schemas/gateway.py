"""Pydantic schemas mirroring the gateway's OpenAI-compatible surface.

The gateway exposes :doc:`/v1/chat/completions <docs/api/gateway-openapi.yaml>`
as its inference entrypoint. This module declares the request and response
shapes the backend uses to talk to that surface. The shapes mirror
``gateway/app/providers/openai_schema.py`` (B3) — by ADR 0003 / CLAUDE.md
they cannot import from ``gateway/`` directly, so the parallel definitions
are kept in sync against the OpenAPI sketch.

LQ.AI extensions documented in ``docs/api/gateway-openapi.yaml``:

* Request side: ``minimum_inference_tier``, ``skill_name``, ``chat_id``,
  ``anonymize``.
* Response side: ``routed_inference_tier``, ``routed_provider``,
  ``cost_estimate``, ``anonymization_applied``.

Permissive policy
-----------------

``extra="allow"`` on the response models so a forward-looking gateway
revision (or a streaming chunk variant we don't know about yet) round-trips
without rejection. The backend reads only the fields it needs.
