"""Pre/post anonymization middleware — M2-B3.

The gateway's substitution surface. Sits between Tier Derivation and
the Provider Adapter (PRD §4.3) on the request path; wraps the
provider's streaming or non-streaming output on the response path.

Three callables form the public API:

* :func:`pre_anonymize_request` — request-path substitution. Mutates
  ``chat_request`` in place to replace entity text with pseudonyms.
  Returns the populated :class:`PseudonymMapper` so the response path
  can rehydrate, or ``None`` if any skip condition is met (the
  caller treats ``None`` as "skip the post-middleware too").
* :func:`post_anonymize_response` — response-path substitution for
  non-streaming responses. Walks each choice's message content and
  replaces pseudonyms with originals.
* :class:`StreamingRehydrator` — incremental tail-buffer rehydrator
  for streaming responses. Solves Decision B (pseudonyms can straddle
  SSE chunk boundaries): we hold an unresolved tail until a complete
  pseudonym crystallizes or the chunk ends.

Skip semantics (any one short-circuits to no-op):

1. ``config.enabled is False`` — master switch.
2. ``routed_tier not in config.apply_at_tiers`` — Tier 1 (local)
   doesn't benefit, and operators can configure which tiers do.
3. ``chat_request.lq_ai_privileged is True`` — Decision A; privileged
   chats are not substituted because rewriting privileged work
   product risks corrupting it.
4. ``chat_request.anonymize is False`` — per-request opt-out.

The conditions are checked top-down; the first hit wins. The mapper
is allocated only when all four conditions pass — when allocation
fails we never persist anything, so a skipped request leaves the
audit log clean.

    Hands chunks of (provider-produced) text in via :meth:`process`;
    emits the same text with pseudonyms substituted by their
    originals. Holds at most a small tail (bounded by the longest
    in-flight pseudonym, typically <30 chars) when the buffer ends in
    a pattern that could still grow into a real pseudonym. Call
    :meth:`flush` at end-of-stream to drain whatever's in the tail.

    Invariants:

    * **No partial pseudonyms ever emit.** A caller seeing the output
      can rely on every byte being either a non-pseudonym character
      or part of a fully rehydrated original.
    * **Bounded buffering.** The buffer never holds more than one
      partial-pseudonym pattern at a time — when a chunk completes
      the pattern (or proves it wasn't one), the held tail flushes.
      Latency is bounded by the pseudonym length, not the stream
      length.
    * **Empty mapper is a no-op.** :meth:`Anonymizer.rehydrate`
      returns its input unchanged when the mapper has no
      assignments, so streams that never produced entities cost only
      the regex scan.
