"""Request-scoped pseudonym assignment — M2-A3.

The mapper sits between the gateway's middleware and the anonymizer
engine: when Presidio (or a custom recognizer) flags an entity span,
the middleware calls :meth:`PseudonymMapper.assign` to get a stable
pseudonym to substitute into the outbound prompt. On the response
path the middleware calls :meth:`PseudonymMapper.reverse` once and
walks the response text replacing pseudonyms with their originals.

Key invariants:

* **Stable per (type, original).** ``assign("PERSON", "John Smith")``
  always returns the same pseudonym within a single mapper instance.
  Same name surfacing twice in one prompt only counts toward one
  counter slot.
* **Per-type counters.** ``PERSON`` and ``ORGANIZATION`` increment
  independently so a transcript that mentions five people and three
  companies reads cleanly: ``PERSON_0001..PERSON_0005`` /
  ``ORGANIZATION_0001..ORGANIZATION_0003``.
* **In-process only.** The mapping is held in plain Python dicts on
  the instance. Never persisted, never logged, never serialized to
  any side channel. A new request gets a new instance; the old one
  is dropped on response.

The format ``{ENTITY_TYPE}_{COUNTER:04d}`` is locked in by the M2
plan's verification step ("returns ``PERSON_0001``"). Five-digit
counter would also have worked; four is the plan's call.
