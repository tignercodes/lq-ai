"""OpenAI-compatible inference endpoints (B4 router + C6 embeddings).

Surface:

* ``POST /v1/chat/completions`` — accepts an OpenAI-format chat-completion
  request, runs it through :class:`app.router.Router`, returns the
  OpenAI-shaped response stamped with ``routed_inference_tier`` and
  ``routed_provider``. The HTTP response also carries the tier in a
  dedicated header (:data:`TIER_HEADER`) so header-only consumers
  (proxies, instrumentation) don't need to parse the body.
* ``POST /v1/embeddings`` — real handler (C6, per ADR 0008). Resolves
  the model through B4's router, dispatches to whichever adapter
  supports embeddings (currently :class:`OpenAIAdapter`), annotates
  tier + provider on the response, writes the routing-log row.
  ``ProviderUnsupportedError`` is fallback-eligible on this path
  (overriding the chat default) so an Anthropic-routed alias falls
  through to the next embedding-capable provider.
* ``GET  /v1/models`` — returns the configured ``model_aliases`` from
  ``gateway.yaml``.

What B4 added on top of B3
--------------------------

* **Real router.** The B3-era ``_resolve_anthropic_target`` is gone;
  alias resolution + tier derivation + dispatch + fallback live in
  :mod:`app.router`. Anthropic remains the only adapter; the dispatch
  is registry-based, so B6 plugs in additional adapters by registering
  themselves rather than touching this handler.
* **Tier annotation.** Every routed request is annotated with
  ``routed_inference_tier`` (1-5). The annotation appears in:

  * The HTTP response header :data:`TIER_HEADER` (header-only consumers).
  * The response body's ``routed_inference_tier`` extension field
    (already documented in ``docs/api/gateway-openapi.yaml``).
  * The ``inference_routing_log`` audit row (DB-backed audit trail).

  Both surfaces are populated for parity. Documented in
  ``docs/api/gateway-openapi.yaml`` and ``docs/PRD.md`` §4.
* **Routing-log writes.** Every request — successful or failed — writes
  one row to ``inference_routing_log`` via the configured
  :class:`app.routing_log.RoutingLogWriter`. The writer never raises
  out of :meth:`write`, so audit-log unavailability cannot block an
  inference call.
* **Fallback chain.** When the primary provider returns a
  fallback-eligible error, the router walks the alias's configured
  ``fallback`` list. With only Anthropic shipped today this is dead
  code in production, but unit-tested with mocked adapters so it's
  ready when B6 lands additional providers.
